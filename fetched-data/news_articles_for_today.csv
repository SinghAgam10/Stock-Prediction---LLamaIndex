Akhilesh calls for oppn unity for positive change in Maha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/akhilesh-yadav-urges-opposition-unity-to-oust-bjp-in-maharashtra-elections/articleshow/114703347.cms,"  Lucknow: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said a ""united opposition"" will unseat BJP-led Mahayuti alliance in Maharashtra polls and free the state from BJP's communal politics. His statement came a day after SP said it was prepared to field candidates on 20 to 25 seats if seat-sharing talks with INDIA bloc partners for Maharashtra do not work out.SP, which has two sitting MLAs, has already announced candidates on five seats in Maharashtra. The candidates were announced after Akhilesh Yadav toured the assembly constituencies and addressed public meetings there earlier this month.Though SP had initially demanded 12 seats from the MVA, party's Maharashtra unit's announcement to contest 20-25 seats was being seen as more of a pressure tactic to extract the best bargain in terms of seats. Sources in SP said the party is prepared to contest on 6 seats in alliance with the MVA. ""In case seat sharing talks fail, we plan to field candidates on at least 10 seats,"" a senior SP functionary told TOI.In the political circles, Akhilesh's call for opposition unity was being seen as a formal attempt to establish that the party was keen to contest the Maharashtra polls as a part of MVA. In his open letter to ""people of Maharashtra"" and the media posted on X, Akhilesh underlined his commitment to defeat the ""enemies of Maharashtra and bring about a positive change"".""With your awareness, the Maharashtra assembly elections will liberate 'Maharashtra' from the BJP's conspiracies of sabotage and its negative politics of communalism. BJP's negative politics is unable to understand the positive strategy and mutual adjustment of the united opposition. BJP's conspiracy to slowly destroy Maharashtra's economy has been exposed,"" he said in the post in Hindi.Accusing the BJP of having destroyed the ""historic harmony and brotherhood"" of Maharashtraian society, Akhilesh said BJP wants to weaken Maharashtra economically, socially and politically to the extent that the state was no longer seen as the economic leader of the country. ""A joint and organised political strategy will bring an end to the Mahadukhi (extremely sorrowful) period of the BJP-led 'Mahayuti',"" he wrote. Maharashtra goes to the polls on Nov 20 and counting will take place on Nov 23.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:00 IST","['city', 'lucknow']",114703347
"Man stabs nephewto death, ends life",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/financial-dispute-leads-to-fatal-stabbing-and-suicide-in-gonda/articleshow/114703354.cms,"  Lucknow: Gonda police reported on Monday that Deepak Pandey fatally stabbed his nephew Vinod Pandey over a financial dispute before committing suicide by jumping in front of a speeding train. The bodies were discovered on the morning of Oct26. Initially, the case seemed mysterious, but CCTV footage and call records helped police piece together the events.According to the police, Deepak had given some money to Vinod which he had refused to repay. In the early hours of Saturday, around 4 am, Deepak called Vinod to a deserted area where a heated argument ensued, leading to the stabbing. Overcome with guilt, Deepak later ended his life by jumping in front of a speeding train. The police claim that Deepak informed his family of the incident from there and subsequently took his own life. . This conclusion was reached after reviewing footage from over 350 CCTV cameras.Superintendent of police, Gonda, Vineet Jaiswal said that they examined the footage from Pathanpurwa, the crime scene, to Chitnapur railway crossing. Vijay's father Ram Kumar Pandey named his relative Deepak Pandey as the suspect in his complaint. Deepak's body was later found near Chitnapur railway crossing in the Katra Bazaar police station area.""On the basis of CCTV cameras, it surfaced that Deepak visited his uncle Dinesh Chandra Pandey in Bhairampur after Vijay's murder. Another CCTV footage from a shop near the bus stand confirmed that both Deepak and Vinod were together before the murder,"" said Jaiswal. ","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:00 IST","['city', 'lucknow']",114703354
Mum firm bags riverfront plot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/mum-firm-wins-prime-riverfront-development-rights-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/114703715.cms,"  Ahmedabad: After over a decade of failed attempts, the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Ltd (SRFDCL) has finally struck a deal, auctioning off development rights on a prime plot on the western side of the riverfront for Rs 156.13 crore.The successful bidder, a leading Mumbai-based real estate company, will now develop a mixed-use commercial building spanning 60,050 sq m, housing upscale offices, co-working spaces, restaurants, retail stores, lounges and a food court.A senior official in SRFDCL told TOI, ""The winning bid for the development rights of the Vallabh Sadan plot came from a Mumbai-based real estate firm, which offered Rs 26,000 per sq m — which is higher than the base price of Rs 23,676 per sq m.""The SRFDCL official added. ""We are not selling the land but development rights of the plot. In a press release, SRFDCL claimed, ""The bid sets a benchmark with a land rate of Rs 3,52,941 per sq m, marking one of the highest land valuations in Ahmedabad.""The auction comes on the heels of the state govt's approval for the Sabarmati Riverfront Land Disposal Policy in July 2024, which paved the way for the sale of development rights for 17 plots totaling 1.49 lakh sq m. ""The successful bidder will now receive the letter of acceptance and must complete the construction in four years,"" the SRFDCL official said, adding that the mixed-use development will feature a building height of 66.13m. ""For the first time a single plot has been approved for commercial mixed-use development,"" claimed the official. Official further added that the land will be leased for 99 years at an annual rate of just Rs 10 per sq m. The successful bidding process, however, was not without its challenges. SRFDCL had initially floated tenders for two plots — one near Vallabh Sadan on the western side and another near Lemon Tree Hotel on the eastern side.""During the pre-bid meeting, private companies raised queries about parking and experience criteria, leading us to amend the tender,"" the SRFDCL official explained. While the Vallabh Sadan plot received bids from two companies, the eastern plot saw only a single bid, prompting authorities to restart the process.

"Denied Palghar ticket, Sena’s Vanga regrets leaving UBT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/shiv-senas-shrinivas-vanga-regrets-leaving-ubt-after-ticket-denial-for-palghar/articleshow/114704405.cms,"  Mumbai: A day after Shiv Sena announced the name of former MP Rajendra Gavit as its candidate for the Palghar assembly seat, incumbent MLA Shrinivas Vanga on Monday expressed remorse for leaving the Uddhav Thackeray-led party. He accused chief minister Eknath Shinde of not fulfilling his commitment to protect loyal members. Vanga made these statements during an emotional press conference.Vanga, 42, broke down in tears, admitting that leaving UBT was a mistake. He was reportedly at the forefront of arranging the rebels' move to Surat in June 2022. In the 2018 Lok Sabha bypoll, necessitated by the death of his father, BJP MP Chintaman Vanga, Shrinivas Vanga hoped to contest but was asked to make way for Gavit, who won the seat in 2018 and 2019.

Fires destroy hundreds of ballots in Oregon and Washington drop boxes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/fires-destroy-hundreds-of-ballots-in-oregon-and-washington-drop-boxes/articleshow/114704357.cms," Authorities investigate smoke pouring out of a ballot box (Pic credit: AP) Authorities on Monday were investigating incidents of early morning fires destroying hundreds of ballots in ballot drop boxes in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington.According to the Portland police bureau, officers and firefighters responded to a fire in a ballot drop box around 3:30 am and determined that an incendiary device had been placed inside. Tim Scott, the Multnomah County elections director, said that a fire suppressant inside the drop box protected nearly all the ballots, with only three being damaged. His office planned to contact those voters to assist them in obtaining replacement ballots.Later, in Vancouver, located across the Columbia River, television crews captured footage of smoke pouring out of a ballot box at a transit centre.Vancouver is the largest city in Washington's 3rd Congressional District, which is expected to have one of the closest US House races in the country between first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Republican challenger Joe Kent.Greg Kimsey, the Clark County auditor in Vancouver, told The Associated Press that the ballot drop box at the Fisher's Landing Transit Center also had a fire suppression system inside, but for some reason, it wasn't effective. Responders pulled a burning pile of ballots from inside the box, and Kimsey said hundreds were lost. ""Heartbreaking,"" Kimsey said. ""It's a direct attack on democracy.""Surveillance cameras covered the drop box and surrounding area, according to Kimsey. The last ballot pickup at the transit centre drop box was at 11 am Saturday, and anyone who dropped their ballot thereafter that was urged to contact the auditor's office to obtain a new one.Kimsey said the office will be increasing the frequency of ballot collections and changing collection times to the evening to prevent ballot boxes from remaining full overnight when similar crimes are considered more likely to occur.On October 8, an incendiary device was also found on or near a ballot drop box in downtown Vancouver. It did not damage the box or destroy any ballots, according to police. The FBI and other agencies had been investigating.Both Washington and Oregon are vote-by-mail states, where registered voters receive their ballots in the mail a few weeks before elections and then return them by mail or by placing them in ballot drop boxes.Last week in Phoenix, officials reported that approximately five ballots were destroyed and others damaged when a fire was set in a drop box at a US Postal Service station.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:23 IST","['world', 'us', 'us-presidential-elections']",114704357

""Lists of anti-social or undesirable elements should be updated, and close monitoring and preventive actions should be taken against such persons,"" he said. ""Crowd control equipment must be in a state of readiness for immediate use. Morning patrols around religious sites should identify any mischief-makers or anti-social elements. CCTV cameras should be checked for functionality, and drones should be used for surveillance at sensitive locations."" the DGP said.

"Student protests escalate in U’khand, 23-yr-old suffers 15% burns after immolation bid in Almora",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/student-protests-turn-violent-in-ukhand-23-year-old-sets-himself-on-fire/articleshow/114704210.cms," 123456 Almora/Dehradun: A 23-year-old MSc student from Almora's Soban Singh Jeena (SSJ) University set himself on fire on Monday as part of ongoing protests against the state govt's decision to cancel student union elections in colleges and universities this year. Deepak Lohani, a candidate for the president's post in the student union at the university, sustained 15% burns, primarily on his hands, stomach, and chest, said doctors.The incident occurred during a protest at Chaughanpata, where Rahul Dhami, the university's current student union president poured petrol on himself. As police tried to de-escalate the situation, Lohani, also a member of the same students's group, set himself on fire after dousing himself with petrol. Police quickly extinguished the flames and rushed Lohani to the district hospital, where he is currently receiving treatment.The issue of students' elections has been simmering for almost a month ever since the deadline given by the state govt to universities for conducting the elections passed. The govt had issued an academic calendar on April 23, directing that student union elections be conducted by Sept 30. However, some of the university administrations failed to organise the elections within the specified time. The matter reached the Uttarakhand high court where a PIL was filed requesting the HC to intervene in getting the student union elections to be held. However, the PIL was dismissed on Oct 24 after the HC accepted the state govt's contention that it is too late into the academic session to hold the elections. Since then, the students' protests have intensified, with several student groups blaming the state govt for stalling the process.In Almora, student organisations had given the call for a protest rally in the Chaughanpata area where they intended to burn effigies of state education minister Dhan Singh Rawat. This came as Amit Bisht, an NSUI member, announced on Saturday that he would self-immolate if their demands were not met by Monday.By Monday morning, Chaughanpata had become a focal point of activity, with students and police bracing for the day's events. Although the crowd's attention was initially on Bisht, it was members of Tiger Group, to which Dhami and Lohani belonged, who sparked the day's volatile turn. The protest quickly escalated, leading to Dhami and Lohani's self-immolation attempts.Afterwards, students continued the demonstration and burnt effigies of the education minister. They warned the govt ""not to test their patience"" and vowed to keep fighting saying they will ""force the state to yield"". Dhan Singh Rawat, reacting to the protests, said, ""We have sought response from the universities regarding the failure to conduct the elections by Sept 30. A double bench of the high court had passed the order to not go against the recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee, which says that student union elections should be held between six to eight weeks after a new academic session starts. Now the students may approach Supreme Court to challenge the HC's order because universities cannot go against it or the Lyngdoh Committee.""Meanwhile, students from other districts also converged in Dehradun on Monday and marched from Congress Bhawan in the state capital to the secretariat. A third-year student of DAV College, Sagar Semwal, had to be rushed to the hospital after he fell unconscious during the protest. Another group of students from colleges in Dehradun also held a ""funeral march"" for Rawat by taking out a procession from DAV college to the secretariat. Students contended that the last elections were also held after a two-month delay, making the decision to cancel it this year an ""undemocratic move"". ""If the admissions were postponed and the last admission was conducted till Sept 25, then preparation should have been made to postpone the student union elections too. The election process teaches every student to be a democratic citizen of the country and is vital for us,"" said Pradeep Singh Tomar, national coordinator (Uttarakhand), NSUI. The protesting students have announced that they will escalate their agitation if the HC's decision is not revoked and dates of the elections not announced.Earlier, on Oct 18, angry over the college's failure to announce the date for student union elections, three students from Haldwani's Moti Ram Babu Ram Government Post Graduate College had climbed on the roof of the principal's office and threatened self-immolation after pouring diesel on themselves. Cops present at the scene quickly took action and brought the students down from the roof. Later, the students issued an apology for their act.On Friday, SSJ university students had locked the campus gates and marched to Chaughanpata, blocking the highway at Gandhi Park and chanting slogans against the govt. Elsewhere in Dehradun, students have set up tents outside DAV College and Dayanand Brijendra Swarup (DBS) College, where they have been camping since Friday. Several colleges in the district have also been forced to shut down due to the agitation. "," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 14:36 IST","['city', 'dehradun']",114704210

They also allegedly collected advance payments for supposed low-cost land deals in Haldwani and Nainital.An STF official said, ""The Bora brothers were believed to be part of a 17-member gang with cases filed across various Pithoragarh police stations.

On October 23, the sessions court had rejected Maloo's bail plea, stating that CID's probe was at a crucial stage, among other grounds to reject the bail plea, which may now come up before the holiday bench of the court for hearing.Sources stated CID too changed its investigation officer in the case and handed it over to another officer who began his probe a couple of days ago.Sessions court judge RS Patil-Bhosale had stated in his order that CID's probe actually began on September 26 when it got her custody through a dramatic order by the magistrate to open the court late in the evening. The court also underlined the fact that the prosecution had waited too long to get custody of Maloo, who mowed down two youngsters on Ram Jhula bridge on February 25 under the influence of liquor. After the regional forensic science laboratory confirmed presence of alcohol in Maloo's blood samples, the charges against her were converted from bailable to non-bailable sections.The case was registered at Tehsil police station, but later shifted to CID by the high court with a direction that it must be probed thoroughly and expeditiously, with a provision of weekly review by a senior official not less than the rank of DySP. In the past, the high court had rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Maloo.Maloo is currently lodged in Nagpur Central Jail after the sessions court rejected her bail plea last week. The sessions court, among other grounds, also mentioned that this was in the ""collective interest of the near and dear ones of the family and community at large"". The sessions court also mentioned that two youngsters, Mohd Atif and Mohd Hussain Mustafa, who lost their lives, were the ""earning hands and future of their families"".The sessions court also mentioned one Sachin Yadav and others who extended help to Maloo and her co-passenger Madhuri Sarda at the accident site before the duo fled the spot. They helped her find Maloo's cellphone in the car. The court also mentioned in the order that sub-inspector Bhawal of Tehsil police station allowed the accused to flee the spot. The accused were arrested after six hours, when Maloo was found in an inebriated condition by Mayo Hospital doctors. The sessions court also mentioned there was a possibility of evidence being tampered with if the accused was released on bail, going by the history of the case.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:00 IST","['city', 'nagpur']",114703355

More than 100 parents joined the demonstration outside Uttarakhand Public School, saying the ongoing tussle between teachers and the management were affecting classes.The protest drew the attention of the district school inspector, city magistrate and police officials, who held a meeting with the teachers, parents and members of the school management to seek a resolution.The protesters said two teachers had already resigned over certain decisions taken by the management. Among them was Poonam Bhandari, who put down her papers last month.Another teacher who participated in the protest said, ""From 2019 to 2024, the school management deducted a portion of teachers' salaries, claiming they had to clear dues of Noida Authority. Though our salary slips showed the entire amount, each teacher took a cut ranging from Rs 6,000-9,000. When the school was sealed for sometime, we realised that the management had not paid any amount to the Authority. Now, the school authorities are denying we took salary cuts."" Manoj Singh, whose son studies at the school, said there was always a tussle between teachers and the management. The school has around 1,500 students.""Such disagreements hinder studies. It's not possible for us to shift schools in the middle of the academic year. Moreover, if teachers are changed when exams are approaching, it will create problems for our kids,"" he added.On April 25 last year, the Authority sealed the school, claiming dues worth 20 crore were yet to be cleared. After the school paid Rs 4.2 crore, the Authority allowed classes to resume and gave the management six months to clear the remaining amount in two instalments.Vandana Tripathi, ACEO at the Authority, said no further payments were made by the school.

BJP turns to workers for Kedar candidate selection after Badrinath defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/bjp-chooses-local-input-for-kedarnath-bypoll-candidate-after-badrinath-setback/articleshow/114704192.cms,"  Dehradun: With an aim to avoid a repeat of the setback faced in Badrinath, BJP has revised its strategy and selected a candidate for the upcoming Kedarnath bypoll based on the feedback and insights provided by its workers on ground, rather than relying on the approach it had previously employed for the state elections. The party has named Asha Nautiyal, president of the BJP's state Mahila Morcha and a two-time MLA, as its candidate for the bypoll scheduled for Nov 20.""This time, the party returned to basics and gathered real-time feedback from local workers before finalising the candidate for the Kedarnath constituency. The party did not want to impose a candidate on the workers like it did in Badrinath, which could demoralise them,"" a senior party leader told TOI.Aditya Kothari, BJP's state general secretary and in-charge for the Kedarnath bypoll, conducted over a dozen meetings at the booth level to assess the sentiments of grassroots party workers before finalising the ticket in light of the challenges encountered in Badrinath, where a recent party entrant from Congress, Rajendra Bhandari, was given the ticket, ultimately resulting in a loss.In selecting Nautiyal, the party placed its bet on an experienced figure over Aishwarya Rawat, daughter of the late MLA Shaila Rani Rawat, who had been viewed as a frontrunner, the sources said. They added that BJP also resisted the ongoing pressure from another strong contender, Kuldeep Rawat, who finished in second place in both the 2017 and 2022 assembly polls. Both Kuldeep and Aishwarya's names were included in the panel of six probable candidates sent by the state unit to the central parliamentary board.Nautiyal, who served as the Kedarnath MLA from 2002 to 2007 and again from 2007 to 2012, lost her seat in the 2012 elections. ""She is a well-known figure and has strong support among the party cadre in Kedarnath, which worked in her favour,"" a BJP leader said.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:15 IST","['city', 'dehradun']",114704192

Maharashtra celebrates first Govatsa Dwadashi post ‘State Mother’ declaration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/maharashtras-historic-govatsa-dwadashi-first-celebration-since-cow-declared-state-mother/articleshow/114703348.cms,"  Nagpur: The state ushered in Diwali with the auspicious Govatsa Dwadashi, a day dedicated to cow worship, marking the official start of the five-day Diwali festivities. This year, the event was extra special as it was the first celebration since Maharashtra declared the cow as ‘Rajya Mata' or ‘State Mother'.Although the model code of conduct restricted political gatherings, the day resonated with traditional reverence as citizens across Nagpur turned to local temples and gaushalas (cow shelters) to pay homage to the revered animal.At Nagpur's Gorakshan Sabha Mandir in Dhantoli, worshippers offered flowers and sweets in a heartfelt ceremony, while Swami Vivekananda Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra in Khapri and Siddhivinayak Gorakshan Dham in Mohgaon Zilpi drew crowds eager to celebrate the sacred bond between human and animal. Many people who didn't have cows at home came to these popular sites for the ceremonial worship.The Pratap Nagar Durga Mandir arranged a cow and calf in the temple premises on Monday morning for common people. Hundreds of residents thronged to worship.""The cow has been held in the highest regard as a motherly figure in Indian culture for centuries,"" said Mahadev Shastri Prabhu, a local priest and religious scholar. ""The recent ‘State Mother' designation is a political recognition of what is already a deeply ingrained belief. Today, our traditional practices take on an even deeper meaning,"" he added.The vibrant celebrations included traditional rituals of cow puja with offerings, tilak, and garlands. ""It's a welcome decision that Maharashtra is the first state to officially honour the cow with this title,"" said a senior member of Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra in Deolpar. ""While politicians weren't formally involved due to the model code of conduct, several still visited in a personal capacity, respecting the spirit of the occasion without the usual fanfare,"" he added.Dhanteras, falling on Tuesday, holds immense significance as it marks the traditional day of prosperity and new beginnings in Diwali festivities. Dhanteras is considered auspicious for purchasing valuable items like gold, silver, and household goods, with many families making it a time to buy new vehicles, appliances, and property. In Nagpur, markets are expected to buzz with eager shoppers, with many stores and showrooms rolling out special offers and discounts, while some retailers plan grand openings to mark the occasion.

He further said at least two rallies each will be organised in Konkan, Pune division, Khandesh (north Maharashtra), Marathwada and Vidarbha.The absence of internal leadership disputes, with CM Eknath Shinde being presented as the face of the alliance, is also expected to create an image of stability and collective governance. ""An incumbent chief minister is seen as the mascot of the alliance. Therefore, there is no dispute as the Mahayuti is contesting the polls under Shinde's leadership,"" a senior functionary said.The Maharashtra strategy aims to demonstrate adeptness at coalition politics and strategic adjustments by ensuring significant stake for each partner to ensure mutual support, while at the same time projecting the incumbent CM as a symbol of effective governance.

"Now, bank guarantee must for millers receiving paddy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bank-guarantee-now-mandatory-for-rice-millers-in-andhra-pradesh-to-curb-paddy-sales/articleshow/114704399.cms,"  Hyderabad: The state govt has decided to make bank guarantee mandatory for millers to prevent them from selling the paddy given to them for custom milling.The state cabinet meeting two days ago approved the bank guarantee clause for rice millers. This was earlier opposed by millers during talks with officials and later with the cabinet sub-committee headed by deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka. But officials claimed to have convinced them that a bank guarantee was necessary, considering that 2,500 crore worth of paddy given for custom milling rice was sold by some rice millers in the past.As per the new rule, millers have been divided into three categories. First, the millers who have never defaulted will have to pay for only 10% of the total paddy given to them as a bank guarantee or security deposit.The second category of millers are those who have defaulted but returned the custom milled rice along with the penalty. They need to deposit 20% of the value as a bank guarantee. The third category of millers have been defined as those who defaulted but returned the rice later without paying the penalty. Such millers would need to make a bank guarantee of 25%. ""We have decided not to give paddy to millers who defaulted and did not give the custom milled rice back to the govt,"" Civil supplies chairman DS Chouhan told TOI.The bank guarantee would be returned to the millers after return of the custom milled rice to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the Civil Supplies Corporation. Earlier, millers were providing rice to FCI as per its specifications and dumping lesser quality rice with the corporation. Consequently, it has now been made mandatory for rice millers to follow a 2:1 ratio, i.e., for every two bags of rice given by millers to the FCI they have to supply one bag to the corporation. This has resulted in quality of rice being delivered to the corporation, he said.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:25 IST","['city', 'hyderabad']",114704399

The air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 188, while it was logged at 239 (poor) on Sunday. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the AQI could deteriorate to ""poor"" or ""very poor"" category over next six days.""Meteorological conditions are likely to be unfavourable for efficacious dispersion of pollutants. Emissions from stubble or waste burning are likely to exacerbate air quality significantly,"" it stated.The CPCB's 24-hour average data revealed that the air monitoring station in Vikas Sadan recorded the day's worst AQI at 246 (poor), while index was 228 (poor) at Teri Gram, 110 (moderate) at Sector 51 and 165 at Gwalpahari.On Monday, both PM2.5 and PM10 levels were substantially above the permissible limits, signifying pollutants from local sources, encompassing vehicular emissions and dust.The PM2.5 level was highest in Vikas Sadan (246 µg/m³), followed by Teri Gram (228 µg/m³), Gwalpahari (165) and Sector-51 (110 µg/m³), according to the CPCB data. PM10 levels were also highest in Vikas Sadan (202 µg/m³), followed by Sector 51 (198 µg/m³), though Vikas Sadan station didn't record PM10 data. According to CPCB, the annual average permissible limits for PM2.5 and PM10 are 60 µg/m³ and 100 µg/m³, respectively.Experts emphasised that year-round monitoring of pollution sources and a reduction in emissions are imperative to tackle air pollution.Meanwhile, health experts cautioned that patients with respiratory or medical conditions are at a higher risk of being affected by deteriorating air quality, especially as the region enters the winter cycle.Meanwhile, Delhi saw its sixth ‘very poor' day of the month on Monday, recording an AQI of 304, compared to 356 a day earlier, according to Central Pollution Control Board's bulletin released at 4pm. The air quality improved marginally to ‘poor' by 6pm, with an AQI of 299, as winds picked up. The air, however, is expected to considerably deteriorate on Diwali day on Thursday.Wind direction on Monday was south-easterly, but the met department's forecast shows it is likely to change to north-westerly on Diwali. North-westerly winds are favourable for transport of smoke from stubble burning sites to Delhi. Experts said winds turn calm during the night time, causing accumulation of pollutants, while light winds prevail during the daytime. However, on Monday, wind speed increased, leading to dispersion of pollutants.""Winds play an important role in dispersion of pollutants in the absence of any significant weather activity like rain, which washes them out. The average wind speed during the daytime on Monday was 15-18 kmph,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice chairman, Skymet Meteorology.The air quality is likely to stay ‘very poor' till Wednesday and may turn ‘severe' on Diwali if there are added emissions from firecrackers and stubble burning.

Lottery baron to face ED investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/santiago-martin-faces-ed-investigation-amidst-lottery-fraud-allegations/articleshow/114704322.cms,"  Chennai: Lottery baron Santiago Martin and his family members face a probe by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and a criminal case investigation, as Madras high court on Monday reversed a magistrate court order accepting the closure report of a case by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the state police. The case pertains to the seizure of 7.2 crore uncounted cash from places associated with him.A division bench of Justice S M Subramaniam and Justice V Sivagnanam has directed the ED to ensure that the case is taken to its logical end. The court passed the order while allowing an appeal moved by the ED seeking to set aside the order passed by a judicial magistrate court to close the 2012 case registered in connection with the seizure of money.In March 2012, the CCB registered a case on the basis of the seizure of 7.2 crore unaccounted money from the premises of one Nagarajan and Moorthy, associates of Martin. However, they claimed to have got the money through the sale of a property to Martin's wife, Leema Rose. A preliminary probe revealed that the sale agreement was entered into on March 2, 2012, but the stamp paper used in the agreement was released by the govt on March 9 and was sold by the stamp vendor on March 13, eight days after the sale agreement was made.The CCB registered the case under various sections of IPC for cheating, forging documents, and hatching a criminal conspiracy. Subsequently, the ED registered a case for money-laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in 2016 based on the FIR filed by the CCB. In 2022, the judicial magistrate closed the case based on a closure report filed by the CCB. Aggrieved, the ED moved the present appeal.Allowing the appeal, the bench said it is a clear case of cheating by amassing money through the sale of illegally printed lottery tickets. It observed that a schematic approach was adopted by the accused persons to escape from the clutches of PMLA proceedings. It noted that for the initiation of PMLA proceedings, a predicate offence is required. During the pendency of a complaint under PMLA, if the predicate offence is closed, as in the present case, it results in a miscarriage of justice, the court said.The court added that the CCB made an attempt to bury the predicate offence case against the accused persons in a suspicious manner and on extraneous considerations, which are visible through their actions, including the filing of the closure report. The judges then quashed the closure order passed by the judicial magistrate and directed the police and ED to proceed with the probe.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:21 IST","['city', 'chennai']",114704322

Dave's case highlights a growing trend: stroke is no longer a disease confined to the elderly.""While the median age for stroke still hovers around 60-65 years in India, it is no longer a condition specific to any age group. In our setting, one out of every five patients today is below 40 years of age,"" said Dr Hetal Parikh, a neurologist with Shalby Hospitals. ""It must be seen in the light of the fact that the onset of other health conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia (abnormal amount of lipids in the blood) and diabetes is occurring at a younger age. Also, cases are being identified earlier due to advancements in diagnostics.""Several other neurologists and neuro-physicians in the city reported a similar trend.

"Stalled for years, project now has a co-developer to complete flats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/major-breakthrough-for-noidas-grand-arista-flats-nimbus-projects-joins-as-co-developer/articleshow/114704333.cms,"  Noida: The Noida Authority has appointed Nimbus Projects Ltd as a co-developer to resume work on the long-stalled The Grand Arista housing project in Sector 168, which was originally allocated to Sunworld Residency Pvt Ltd.Both Sunworld and Nimbus will now jointly clear dues that were recalculated after the original developer opted for a zero-period waiver under the state govt's rehabilitation policy for stalled projects. It was in Sept that Noida Authority's chief executive officer, Lokesh M, approved Nimbus as the co-developer following a request from Sunworld. The formal approval was granted by the Authority board on Saturday, offering a relief to buyers who have been waiting for their flats for years.Apart from clearing dues, Nimbus will also be responsible for completing the project in time along with Sunworld. According to Sunworld's agreement with Nimbus, the co-developer will complete the remaining towers in Phase 2, develop common areas, clubhouse and other amenities. Nimbus also has the authority to manage, sell and transfer all Phase 2 flats, with Sunworld providing land access and assistance with required documentation.""Nimbus has accepted responsibility for settling dues within a stipulated period. According to its deal with Sunworld, Nimbus will complete construction in keeping with the approved plan and bear sole responsibility for the completion, handover and saleable area management of Phase 2 of the project. All risks or disputes related to Phase 2 will fall on Nimbus, excluding Sunworld from any liability,"" an official said. If the project is delayed, a 20% penalty on dues will apply after a three-year extension. The Authority will also be liable to intervene and take steps to complete the project.Within 15 days, Nimbus will have to apply with the Authority to become the co-developer, making both responsible for dues and project completion.""The approval of Nimbus as the co-developer underscores the Authority's strategy to revitalise delayed projects, protect homebuyers' interests, and enforce accountability. By bringing in third-party developers, the Authority aims to address financial and operational setbacks that often impede large housing projects,"" the official said.Since 2010, The Grand Arista project has changed multiple hands. Initially, 40,221sqm was allotted to Boulevard Infrastructure Pvt Ltd for Rs 94.9 crore, but later transferred to Sunworld Residency in 2012. Set for completion by 2017, the project only had seven of 10 proposed towers ready while occupancy certificates were issued for 400 of 972 flats by July 2019.With mounting dues, the Authority sealed the three incomplete towers on March 31 last year.After Sunworld opted for the govt's rehabilitation policy, the Authority asked the company to pay 25% of its outstanding dues of Rs 42.3 crore within 60 days. Sunworld deposited Rs 10.3 crore, and proposed appointing Nimbus Projects as the co-developer. It also committed to jointly pay the remaining Rs 32 crore.The Noida Authority CEO gave its approval in Sept itself, following which the board backed the decision this Saturday.

Demand conditions in economy need to be watched: Finance ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/demand-conditions-in-economy-need-to-be-watched-finance-ministry/articleshow/114704409.cms,"  NEW DELHI: The outlook for the Indian economy is good, underpinned by a stable external sector, positive agricultural scenario, expected improvements in demand supported by the festive season, a finance ministry report said on Monday but cautioned that demand conditions in the economy need to be watched.The latest concern over urban demand comes close on the heels of two top FMCG companies - Nestle and HUL - flagging sluggish urban sales due to stubborn food inflation, while rural demand appeared to be improving and some weak economic indicators pointing to a sort of slowdown.The finance ministry's monthly economic review for Sept said rural demand continues to improve, as reflected in increasing FMCG volume sales and a rise in three-wheeler and tractor sales but seemed to express concern over slowing urban demand. ""However, urban demand appears to moderate due to softening consumer sentiments, limited footfall due to above-normal rainfall and seasonal periods during which people tend to refrain from new purchases,"" said the report.It said contrary to rural demand, there has been evidence of a slowdown in urban demand as reflected in performance of various indicators in first half of FY25 and cited slowing FMCG, auto and housing sales in urban centres.Latest data also showed that the country's industrial output contracted for first time in 22 months in Aug, dragged down by a high base effect and decline in mining and electricity and a weak manufacturing sector. ""Going forward, the ongoing festive season and improvement in consumer sentiments may boost urban consumer demand. However, early indications were not particularly promising,"" the report cautioned.But, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said there are mixed signals about demand and positives outweigh negatives.""What I would like to emphasise is that there are mixed signals... The so-called slowdown in certain areas is outweighed by the positives that we are getting,"" Das said in an interview to CNBCTV18 in Washington.Become an Excel Pro in 2024!

Why non-duty paid liquor hurts T revenue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/the-impact-of-non-duty-paid-liquor-on-telanganas-revenue-generation/articleshow/114704369.cms,"  Why are NDPL regulations in place in state?Non-Duty Paid Liquor is classified based on VAT and excise duty. The state govt collects both these taxes on every bottle produced and sold within the state, which adds to its revenue. However, if a consumer brings liquor from another state, it falls under NDPL category. The local government then loses out on revenue, which is why regulations are in place to curb NDPL.How do officials check for it?There exists a system whereby officials can verify, using a mobile scanning application, whether a bottle has been supplied to local wine shops from the depots of the Telangana State Beverages Corporation. Holograms on the bottles assist in this verification process. Liquor from other states is also often sold at lower prices, prompting many to attempt to bring it into the state.Are there authorised brands of liquor? The state has authorised over 1,000 brands of liquor. These brands may be produced in distilleries in state or outside, provided the companies obtain permission from the state government to produce them externally.How is NDPL different from illegal liquor?If a consumer purchases liquor that is permitted in the state, but sourced from another state, it constitutes NDPL case. However, illegal liquor is when it is produced within in state, but not in authorised distilleries, where the quality of the liquor is compromised.Any recent cases in Telangana?Event managers and racketeers frequently source liquor from other states to provide for events and their regular clientele. In fact recently, the excise department seized 470 bottles of beer valued at 12 lakh that were being transported from Goa to Telangana. Some individuals returning from a holiday were carrying these bottles.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:24 IST","['city', 'hyderabad']",114704369

He applied for regular bail on Oct 19. While Langa claimed innocence, the prosecution vehemently opposed the bail plea.After hearing the arguments, additional chief judicial magistrate M V Chauhan rejected Langa's bail plea and stated in his order, ""After perusing the case papers, the probe reveals that the accused seems to have played an active role in this offence. The investigation is underway and there is a possibility of evidence being tampered with.""The court said that the alleged offence has been registered under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 474 and 120B of the IPC, and there is a provision of imprisonment up to 10 ye5ars or life imprisonment. ""Perusal of the case papers reveals that Langa, in connivance with co-accused, hatched a criminal conspiracy to evade income tax and GST; entered into a financial transaction of Rs 43,35,949 with Dhruvi Enterprise to obtain bogus ITC and caused the loss of crores of rupees to the nation. He appears to have committed the serious crime,"" the court noted in its order.The court also stated that for his own financial gain, to avoid taxes, and to cause loss to the govt, Langa made his wife a partner in a firm named D A Enterprise, but managed it by himself in connivance with the co-accused. The court further stated, ""Despite being a reputed journalist, for his financial gain, the accused evaded taxes by making fake bills in the name of Dhruvi Enterprise and by entering into financial transactions with it. An amount of Rs 20 lakh was discovered from his house which was seized.""Meanwhile, a city sessions court on Monday denied bail to four co-accused arrested in this case. They are Brirajsinh Sarvaiya, Ranmal Dasa, Jignesh Desai and Pradeep Dodiya.In another development, the city crime branch arrested three more persons — Sanay Rudhani from Junagadh, Dilip Tank from Porbandar and Sudhir Raiyani from Rajkot district — in connection with this case.

Aadhaar-based registration likely for Common Entrance Test candidates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-to-introduce-aadhaar-based-registration-for-cet-amid-seat-blocking-concerns/articleshow/114703351.cms,"  Bengaluru: Following suspicions of the blocking of engineering seats in top colleges this year, the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) has proposed Aadhaar-based registration for the Common Entrance Test (CET), which is the gateway for admissions to engineering and other professional undergraduate courses.TOI had reported in these columns on Oct 26 that while attempting to issue notices to students who were allotted seats but didn't report to colleges, KEA found that many of the phone numbers provided by candidates for counselling were fake. As many as 2,348 candidates failed to pay the fee and report to their respective engineering colleges. This raised suspicion of seat blocking as some of the most-coveted computer science engineering and allied seats from top colleges were among the seats that went unfilled even after being allotted.ComedK also found the same trend in its counselling. ComedK wrote to the admission-overseeing committee, raising suspicion in the admissions to nearly 140 seats in two prestigious engineering colleges in Bengaluru. ComedK stated that 18 students from different states who didn't join the college had given the same phone number.""Our proposal is Aadhaar numbers should be used for registration. As soon as Aadhaar is entered, an OTP will be generated and sent to the linked phone number. With this, we'll be able to curb the practice of using fake phone numbers to register,"" said H Prasanna, executive director of KEA. ""We'll have a meeting with the e-governance team to tighten security.""The proposal has been sent to the department of e-governance, which will forward it to UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) for concurrence.ComedK said it will also devise means to ensure the phone numbers provided by candidates are valid. ""In the past, when we found the same phone numbers for many students, the candidates gave the excuse that they were from rural areas and had to approach cyber cafes for registration, thus ending up with the same number. But this time, we found the same phone number for students from different states,"" said ComedK secretary S Kumar.KEA will also submit a report to the higher education department on its suspicion of alleged seat blocking after waiting for a week for the students' responses to the notices.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:00 IST","['city', 'bengaluru']",114703351

"What is Osteoporosis, high risk in women and why is it getting more common than we think",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/what-is-osteoporosis-high-risk-in-women-and-why-is-it-getting-more-common-than-we-think/articleshow/114691534.cms,"  Osteoporosis is a chronic, progressive bone disease that is known for decreased bone density and quality, making bones fragile and more susceptible to fractures. It is often referred to as a ""silent disease"" as, up until a fracture, it shows no visible symptoms. About one in three women and one in five men over 50 suffer from this illness, according to a study published in Osteoporosis International. Osteoporosis is becoming more and more prevalent worldwide, and women are particularly vulnerable. Here is a closer look at the reasons behind the increase in osteoporosis cases, why women are more at risk, and why it is more frequent than we realize.What is Osteoporosis?Osteoporosis weakens bones by decreasing their structural integrity and density. The bones become porous, with wider holes inside that can even look like a honeycomb structure. This automatically increases the risk of fractures which more commonly happen in the wrist, hip, and spine. The disease remains undetected until a minor fall results in a fracture, highlighting the need for early diagnosis and prevention.Several factors, such as age, genetics, lifestyle, and underlying health conditions, contribute to bone loss. Many people are not aware they have osteoporosis until they suffer a fracture, making early awareness and preventive measures very important.Why are women at higher risk?Women face a higher risk of developing osteoporosis compared to men. Here are some reasons why:A greater decrease in bone density results from the menopausal drop in estrogen levels, which causes bone loss. In general, women's bones are thinner and smaller than men's. Because of their naturally lower bone mass, women are more affected than males by bone loss brought on by ageing or hormonal changes.Because of the increased need for calcium during pregnancy and lactation, women may temporarily lose bone. Over time, bone density may be impacted if the body's calcium requirements are not satisfied.Why is Osteoporosis becoming more common?Several factors contribute to the rising prevalence of osteoporosis worldwide:As life expectancy increases, so does the number of older adults, who are at a higher risk of osteoporosis. As the world's population ages, more people will suffer from age-related bone loss, which will raise the disease's total incidence.Sitting for a longer duration of time and doing less physical activity are common features of modern lifestyles. Frequent muscle-strengthening and weight-bearing activities are essential for preserving bone health. Our inactivity might seem relaxing but it actually damages bone health.Diets that don't contain enough calcium and vitamin D can be bone-damaging. Vitamin D helps in the absorption of calcium, which is necessary for bone growth. These nutritional deficiencies are widespread and can hasten the loss of bone.A higher risk of osteoporosis is connected with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and thyroid issues.Early menopause: What it means and why it happensHow Osteoporosis impacts women's healthOsteoporosis can have severe consequences for women, affecting their quality of life and increasing the risk of disability:Osteoporosis-related fractures can lead to chronic discomfort and impairment. Significant mobility issues can result from hip fractures in particular. This might also frequently call for surgery and extensive physical therapy. The suffering women might not recover completely, which could result in them losing their independence.A slumped posture or kyphosis (hunchback) can result from compression fractures in the spine.Breathing difficulties, constant pain, and a general decline in quality of life are just some basic results of this.Anxiety and low physical activity in everyday life might result from the dread of falling and fracturing a bone, which can at times become depressive and lonely.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:00 IST","['life-style', 'health-fitness', 'health-news']",114691534

"Woman scams Rs 1.77 crore with fake airline jobs, evades arrest with plastic surgery",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/woman-scams-rs-1-77-crore-with-fake-airline-jobs-evades-arrest-with-plastic-surgery/articleshow/114703401.cms,"  A unique scam case involving fake airline job offers, elaborate deception, and plastic surgery has surfaced in China. The woman, known by her surname ‘Xie,’ was recently caught by Thai police after the Thai Immigration Police received a tip-off. As per reports, the woman defrauded more than 1.5 million yuan and underwent surgery to evade the authorities.The Thai Immigration Police received a tip-off from local residents who reported that a 30-year-old woman was living in Bangkok and seemed suspicious. They said the woman was often seen covering her face and wearing a mask, which raised suspicions that she might be an illegal immigrant.Acting on the tip-off, the authorities soon visited Xie’s flat and encountered her when she was coming downstairs to pick up a food delivery order, requesting to check her passport. Upon inquiry, the police found that Xie had entered Thailand in late 2022 as a tourist and acquired a visa on arrival. The VOA permitted her a 15-day stay, but it was discovered she had exceeded her visa stay by over 650 days. Xie was arrested on account of overstaying her visa.However, the story had one more twist left. During the investigation, Xie told the police she was a flight attendant for a renowned airline before her dismissal. Soon, they discovered that Xie was on Interpol’s Blue Notice list. Reportedly, between 2016 and 2019, Xie managed to swindle six people by promising them a position as a flight attendant at major airlines. She then underwent plastic surgery and fled to Thailand.According to reports, Xie created a fake online profile of a wealthy flight attendant, often posting photos of various overseas destinations that made her page look authentic. She had started fooling people back in 2014. Wu, her younger cousin, has been named as one of the accusers in the case, revealing that Xie had also stolen some money from her in 2018.Reports indicate Xie will first be penalized under Thai law for overstaying her visa, after which she will be deported back to China, where she will face charges for her fraudulent activities, which include building a fake persona and swindling people’s money. This is not the first time a criminal has undergone plastic surgery to evade authorities. Lao Rongzhi, a woman from China wanted for multiple murders, managed to avoid police capture through surgery. She was apprehended in 2019 and executed in 2023.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:05 IST","['etimes', 'trending']",114703401

Tiger sightings reported in Coimbatore forest division,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/startling-tiger-sightings-in-coimbatore-forest-division-raise-conservation-awareness/articleshow/114704327.cms,"  Chennai: In the past few months, tiger sightings have been reported in about half a dozen locations outside protected areas in the Coimbatore forest division.Boluampatty, Karamadai, Madukkarai, and Pillayar Valley are some of the ranges where the big cats were sighted, according to conservator of forests, Coimbatore forest circle, S Ramasubramanian. Boluampatty and Madukkarai ranges are in the southern part of the forest division, while, the Karamadai, Mettupalayam, and Sirumugai ranges are adjacent to Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. To determine the actual number of tigers in their division, the department sought the help of the World Wide Fund for Nature - India (WWF-I), which suggested that the authorities set up camera traps in 350 locations. Two cameras have to be set up in each location. Four hundred of these traps have already been installed by WWF researchers at locations where the sightings were reported, Ramasubramanian said.A senior researcher from WWF-I said a total of 800 cameras need to be installed where tiger movement was reported. About 50% has already been installed. The remaining will be done soon. The movement of tigers outside protected areas indicate that they are well connected with ‘tiger bearing' sites, he said. Ramasubramanian said the camera traps were set up as per the guidelines of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in the Coimbatore forest division. A survey was conducted before installing the camera. A tiger was recorded during a trial camera trapping. ""This assessment will provide a complete understanding of tigers within the Coimbatore forest division,"" he said. The WWF source said when the tigers appear in an area, it is an indication that the habitat is healthy.

After it became clear Chikhalikar would not be given another chance to contest the LS bypolls, an internal arrangement in the Mahayuti alliance was made, and he switched over to NCP. He is now contesting the assembly election from his home turf of Loha.Hambarde, who holds a PhD with an extensive academic background, runs multiple educational institutions and business ventures.His career as an academic includes a tenure as head of the computer department at the Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University in Nanded. He was also the University's deputy vice-chancellor till 2014, and resigned from the position to join BJP. The shift into politics was significant, considering Hambarde's brother is a sitting Congress MLA.Nanded bypoll is shaping up to be a triangular battle with Syed Imtiaz Jaleel, state president of AIMIM, also entering the fray. His candidacy has added another dimension to local election dynamics, with AIMIM aiming to consolidate its influence in the region.Tuesday being the deadline for filing of nominations, political activity in Nanded has intensified. Each candidate brings distinct regional, family and ideological influences, making this bypoll a significant test for all three players: BJP, Congress and AIMIM.Nanded locals also said they're expecting a candidate from VBA to enter the poll fray as well.For BJP, Hambarde's background in education and administration positions him as a candidate who could resonate with voters looking for a developmental agenda. The Congress on the other hand has sought to maintain continuity by nominating Ravindra Chavan. AIMIM's Jaleel, meanwhile, hopes to mobilise support among minority communities.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:25 IST","['city', 'aurangabad']",114704392

Trash, dumped continuously, has engulfed a rivulet in Dhouj village of Faridabad. In Mangar, a stream traversing through protected forest areas has been split into two because of garbage deposits. Both these areas are protected under Section 4 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), which bars any non-forest activities in the region.Locals told TOI on Monday that waste is dumped openly in the Aravalis every day. ""At least ten or more trucks discard municipal waste, construction and demolition waste, and plastic here, daily,"" said Vikas, a resident of Mangar village. Environmentalists alleged that illegal waste dumping was common in the area, and it has been contaminating groundwater in the Aravalis for decades.""We have been informing the civic body about dumping of waste in creeks and in water bodies, but there has been no stringent action,"" said Sunil Harsana, an environmentalist and wildlife expert who lives in Mangar. Harsana said contaminating water bodies was not the only concern. ""Natural water drainage and groundwater recharge systems get affected when waste is dumped on water bodies and streams. These creeks are connected to lakes, and any obstacle will prevent water from naturally flowing into these water bodies, harming even wildlife in the area,"" he said. Forest department officials, when asked about waste dumping, said they will look into the allegations and write to the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad to remove garbage from forest areas. ""We will investigate and take action to remove the waste,"" said Rajeev Tejiyan, district forest officer, Faridabad.""We are committed to addressing the concerns raised about waste management in Faridabad's forest areas. We will look into the situation and ensure that no further waste is dumped till we find a suitable and approved site for disposal,"" an MCF official said.Illegal waste dumping is being reported at a time when the Gurgaon and Faridabad municipal corporations are struggling to scale up their waste management capacity and find alternative land for treating garbage. The two NCR cities add 2,200 MT of garbage at the Bandhwari landfill, located near Mangar along the Gurgaon-Faridabad highway, every day. In 2022, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed Gurgaon and Faridabad to stop dumping fresh waste at Bandhwari and clear legacy waste piling up in the landfill within a specific time frame. The process is still going on. In May earlier this year, the state wildlife department also contemplated withdrawing the no-objection certificate (NOC) it had issued for the Bandhwari waste treatment plant due to damage to the surrounding Aravalis. A survey by the wildlife department last year had found that MCG's waste concessionaire was ""intentionally"" spilling leachate from the Bandhwari plant into the eco-sensitive Aravalis, contaminating groundwater of five nearby villages.Dhouj Mangar ","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:19 IST","['city', 'gurgaon']",114704273

Somehow, he completed his studies in the English language. The Tamil language test is now insisted upon, which contains a written examination and a viva-voce,"" said Justice N Anand Venkatesh. Considering the disability suffered by the petitioner, it is beyond comprehension as to how the petitioner will attend the viva-voce test. Hence, the petitioner has to be reasonably accommodated in the given circumstances by granting exemption to the petitioner from clearing the language test, the judge said.""The petitioner, after a long struggle, entered the services of the housing board and he was working for the last 10 years. If he is now shown the door, he will be virtually left in the streets without any employment, considering the disability suffered by him. Therefore, the case in hand is one such deserving case where such exemption can be granted to the petitioner,"" the court said.""…a person suffering from disability should not be put to undue hardship by imposing conditions which are normally imposed for able-bodied persons,"" Justice Anand Venkatesh said. The barriers faced by persons with disabilities go beyond just physical accessibility issues, extending to deep-rooted prejudice, stereotypes, and misconceptions that pervade many aspects of society, the court said.""From education and employment to health care and public services, persons with disabilities often face significant obstacles that hinder their full participation and inclusion. In view of the same, a constitutional court must develop an understanding of the societal, attitudinal, cultural, institutional, structural, legal, and environmental barriers that persons with disabilities encounter daily,"" the court said. The constitutional court must strive to remove these barriers through their rulings, he added.The court passed the order on a plea moved by B Vidyasagar, assistant engineer, technical cell, Tamil Nadu Housing Board, seeking direction to the govt not to insist the petitioner produce the certificate of passing the Tamil language test in the light of a GO dated May 23, 2022.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:15 IST","['city', 'chennai']",114704208

He also provided the minutes of various meetings where KCR had directed the irrigation officials to finalise the designs and drawings, which were approved by him. Venkateshwarlu told the commission that he only implemented the orders of the govt and his superiors.The former ENC of Ramagundam circle, under which the three barrages of Medigadda, Sundilla and Annaram come under, said the department filled the three barrages to full capacity on the directions of the head of the govt. Venkateshwarlu said the barrages were filled to provide irrigation water to the farmers in the ayacut.This is the fourth time Venkateshwarlu, who was removed by the Congress govt after it came to power, appeared before the one-man inquiry commission on Monday. He provided proofs and documents of various decisions taken by the BRS govt on the Kaleshwaram project. On the sinking of piers in block 7 of Medigadda barrage, he said that it was due to operation and maintenance issues and opined that the barrage was damaged due to non-availability of tail water and operation of gates.

Operational deficiencies haunt Athikadavu-Avinashi scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/urgent-fixes-needed-for-troubled-athikadavu-avinashi-water-supply-project/articleshow/114704053.cms,"  Coimbatore: It was in August this year when chief minister M K Stalin inaugurated the Athikadavu-Avinashi groundwater recharge and drinking water supply project after a long wait. Much to the disappointment of farmers and NGOs, water supply is being interrupted with miscreants stealing various project equipment and electricity officials failing to schedule maintenance work at the six pumping stations simultaneously.Pointing to the operational deficiencies, the farmers and NGOs said the same was causing loss to the state exchequer and urged the state govt to implement critical emergency measures to make things right.The scheme, which diverts 1.5 thousand million cubic feet of surplus water from the downstream of Kalingarayan anicut across the Bhavani river to 1,045 waterbodies across Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode districts, was completed at a cost of Rs1,916.41 crore.P K Selvaraj, founder, Kousika Neerkarangal, said the outlet management systems, which were used to monitor and control water flow to waterbodies, were installed in open places, making them vulnerable to theft and unauthorized operation. ""At Vaiyamapalayam check dam in Coimbatore, solar control panels, battery and valves were stolen. Those items are yet to be replaced with new ones. Because of this, water supply is hit. The outlet management systems should be protected by installing a fence around them.""Vetrivel, coordinator, Kousika Neerkarangal, said the lack of additional ground valves was leading to water loss whenever a pipeline was damaged. ""The route map of the pipeline isn't provided to the local bodies or the highways department, leading to accidental pipeline damage during road maintenance. The absence of outlet valves before pipeline diameter transitions often leads to blockages, disrupting water flow.""At Kulathupalayam, he said, the panchayat had damaged the Athikadavu scheme pipeline without knowing that the pipe was laid there. ""It took a day to rectify the damage. In Moperipalayam and Kittampalayam alone, pipes were damaged in 10 places. A gate valve was stolen at Kittamalayam and air valves were stolen at Ganapathipalayam and Papampatti, leading to pipeline leakage and disruption in water supply.""Short-staffed, the Water Resources Department is also not in a position to oversee the running of the project, says another source.A farmer from Agarakarasamakulam, meanwhile called for the formation of an inclusive committee, comprising govt authorities, beneficiaries and all stakeholders. ""Conflicting EB maintenance schedules at the six pumping stations affect the scheme to a large extent.Another farmer, Balakrishnan, of Rayarpalayam, said the scheme had to be fully utilized whenever surplus water was available as it is planned to supply water for only 70 days a year.

Cops have also been deployed at 51 locations across various market areas to manage traffic. Ghaziabad police are also offering an escort service for shop owners and businessmen carrying cash home.The measures aim to reduce snatching and robbery cases that typically occur during the festive season, police said.According to commissioner of police Ajay Kumar Mishra, studies show that criminals often target business people returning home at night with cash. To combat this, the police are providing Cheetah vehicles to escort these individuals safely. Those in need of assistance can notify their local police station before leaving.Cops have also identified 600 criminals from Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Meerut, and surrounding areas, who have committed crimes in Ghaziabad. As of Sunday night, 80% of the criminal verifications had been completed. More than 90% of these criminals have been involved in robberies and two-wheeler thefts.To counter this, police have established check posts at 115 locations across the district, inspecting all two-wheelers and other vehicles. Officers are asking suspects to remove helmets and masks during checks to match their identities against police records.As people flock to NH-9, DME, Lal Kuan, and Kaushambi Bus Depot for transportation, police have deployed officers at 51 key locations in various market areas to manage traffic as well.ADCP (traffic) Piyush Singh said that over 600 traffic police officers are stationed at markets, highways, expressways, and busy depots to ensure smooth traffic flow.

"Nagpur Rural: Rebels, smaller parties look to play spoilspot",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nagpur-rural-elections-insights-on-key-contenders-and-potential-spoilers/articleshow/114703876.cms,"  INTRO: The contenders of Mahayuti and Maha Vikas Aghadi are embroiled in a fierce battle across six constituencies in Nagpur rural. In 2014, the BJP emerged victorious in five seats, except for Saoner, where MLA Sunil Kedar thwarted their clean sweep. In 2019, the BJP and Congress won two seats each. NCP (SP) senior leader Anil Deshmukh staged a comeback in Katol, and an independent candidate Ashish Jaiswal triumphed in Ramtek. This time, the stakes are high for both mega alliances, as rebels and smaller parties are poised to play a pivotal role in the outcome. TOI's Vaibhav Ganjapure, Abhishek Choudhari & Proshun Chakraborty analise the constituenciesKampteeBawankule's Comeback Trail: Can Bhoyar Break BJP's Winning Streak?Chandrashekhar Bawankule (BJP) vs Suresh Bhoyar (Congress)The constituency is set to witness the resurgence of BJP Maharashtra president Chandrashekar Bawankule, who was denied a ticket in the 2019 polls by the BJP's central leadership. His opponent, Congress candidate Suresh Bhoyar, suffered a defeat to the incumbent MLA Tekchand Sawarkar in 2019 by a margin exceeding 11,000 votes. Bawankule had previously emerged victorious in the seat on three occasions – in 2014, 2009, and 2004. In 2014, he vanquished former Congress minister Rajendra Mulak by a staggering 40,000 votes, and in 2009, he trounced Congress candidate Sunita Gawande by over 31,000 votes. Congress has reaffirmed its confidence in Bhoyar, a former Zilla Parishad member, who aspires to mount a formidable challenge against the BJP state chief. With Bawankule's re-entry, the constituency is poised to garner significant attention. While Bawankule, an MLC, aims to maintain his reputation, Bhoyar seeks to upset his applecart by capitalizing on factors such as anti-incumbency and caste-based equations. The performance of smaller parties like the VBA, BSP, and AIMIM may prove to be a spoilsport.KatolLegacy on the line in triangular fightCharansing Thakur (BJP) vs Salil Deshmukh (NCP Sharad Pawar)For nearly two weeks, speculation swirled regarding who from Mahayuti would contest from Katol against the five-time MLA and senior NCP leader Anil Deshmukh. Initially, the NCP led by Deputy CM Ajit Pawar staked claim to the seat, and Pawar even held a solitary rally in the town during his visit to Vidarbha. The BJP unit was also reluctant to concede the seat to its ally. Former Katol MLA Ashish Deshmukh had also expressed his desire to contest the seat, having defeated his uncle Anil in the 2014 polls. However, the BJP ultimately reposed faith in its leader from the constituency, Charansing Thakur, who had suffered defeats twice to Anil Deshmukh in 2009 and 2019. On the other hand, Deshmukh surprised everyone by allotting the ticket to his son Salil, a Zilla Parishad member. Yajnavalkya, son of the late Congress stalwart Shrikant Jichkar, had also demanded a ticket from the party, asserting that it was his father's seat. After being denied the ticket, he has filed his nomination as an independent candidate. His entry is likely to transform the contest into a triangular battle, and it will be intriguing to see who emerges victorious. The question remains whether Deshmukh's son can make a mark in his debut or if Thakur will be fortunate on his third attempt or Jichkar would continue his father's legacy.HingnaShowdown between BJP & NCP (SP)Hingna is poised for a direct confrontation between the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar and the BJP. Initially, internal competition within the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) complicated the candidate selection process, as both the Congress and NCP vied for the ticket. Traditionally an NCP stronghold, the MVA ultimately chose to renominate former MLA Ramesh Bang, while the BJP fielded its three-time sitting MLA, Sameer Meghe.Adding an intriguing dimension, the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) is also fielding a candidate, as in previous elections, where it typically garnered between 9,000 and 15,000 votes—a factor that could potentially benefit the BJP. Congress leaders, including senior party figure Sunil Kedar, had initially advocated for Kunda Raut, Zilla Parishad vice-president and Kedar's loyalist, to secure the Congress nomination. Shiv Sena (UBT) also staked its claim to the seat, with a local delegation led by Harshal Kakde appealing to senior Sena (UBT) leader Bhaskar Jadhav to secure ticket. The decision to overlook these requests has sparked discontent among grassroots workers in the Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress camps, where party loyalists feel marginalized in the high-stakes contest for Hingna.SaonerAnuja Kedar (Congress) vs Ashish Deshmukh (BJP)Dynastic Duel: Kedar's wife vs DeshmukhIn Saoner, a long-standing bastion of disqualified MLA Sunil Kedar, expectations were high for another decisive contest in favor of the Congress. Kedar, a five-time winner in the region, has now introduced his wife, Anuja Kedar, as the Congress candidate. Anuja, hailing from a prominent political lineage, is the daughter of former Nagpur mayor Kundatai Vijaykar and granddaughter of the late Maharashtra minister Shashirao Wankhede.While Congress has chosen Anuja, the BJP has nominated former MLA Ashish Deshmukh, the elder son of veteran Congress leader Ranjit Deshmukh. In a twist of personal and political rivalry, Sunil Kedar, running as an independent, once defeated Ashish's father, a former MPCC president and state minister. Now, Ashish has the opportunity to avenge his father's loss by challenging Kedar's wife in what promises to be a high-stakes face-off.Although the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) has also fielded a candidate, the primary battle remains a direct showdown between the Congress and BJP. The influential Kunbi community, particularly the Tirde and Dhanoje sub-castes, will play a pivotal role in determining the outcome. The Tirde Kunbis, who have traditionally supported Kedar, have been a key factor in his consistent victories in Saoner.RamtekSena vs. Sena: Shinde's Seasoned Faces Uddhav's NewcomerAshish Jaiswal (Sena Shinde) vs Vishal Barbate (Sena UBT)This is the sole constituency in Nagpur district where a Sena vs Sena battle is on the horizon. Ashish Jaiswal, who won as an independent in 2019, has now joined the Shiv Sena Shinde faction to become their official candidate for the polls. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena has made a surprise choice in Vishal Barbate, who has yet to prove his mettle in assembly polls.On paper, the Shinde faction has the upper hand, as their candidate Jaiswal has emerged victorious in the Ramtek seat four times (non-consecutively) and is confident of securing a fifth win. CM Eknath Shinde has consistently portrayed Jaiswal as his close aide, holding multiple public events in Ramtek where he urged people to vote for Jaiswal. CM Shinde has publicly stated that ""all major development"" in the region has been accomplished due to Jaiswal's insistence.On the other hand, the Uddhav faction's Barbate is untested in the constituency but is relying on the party's cadre base in the region to clinch the seat. However, problems have already surfaced for Barbate, and they do not stem from Mahayuti. Within the MVA, the Congress was confident of securing the seat and may not actively participate in the campaign. Congressman Chandrapal Chouksey has already filed his nomination as an independent candidate, which is likely to impact MVA votes."," Oct 29, 2024, 00:09 IST","['city', 'nagpur']",114703876

However, the TGERC allowed this for consumers using above 800 units a month. Fixed charges for lift irrigation were increased from 275 to 300 a month. Similarly, townships and residential colonies saw an increase in fixed charges from the existing 260 to 285. The discoms had requested 300 a month. The commission rejected increases in fixed charges and energy charges for high-tension consumers, airports, and bus stations.""For non-domestic and commercial users in low-tension, there was a reduction in fixed charges from 60 per KW to 30 per KW for consumption up to 50 units, and the monthly minimum energy charge was reduced from 65 to 50 per month for single-phase supply and from 200 to 100 per month for three-phase supply.

Similarly, the upper limit of connected load for sheep farming, goat farming, and dairy farming activities increased from 15 HP to 25 HP.TGERC reduced the fixed charges from 50 per KW to zero for EV charging stations to promote EV vehicles.

However, the plots did not attract any applications. A second round too failed to get bidders.According to Authority officials, over the past two years, national and multinational companies have shown a greater interest in IT/ITES. A recent intra-department report too, highlighted Noida's rapid growth in the sector over the past two decades and noted that numerous IT/ITES companies set up operations in the region, contributing significantly to revenue and employment.Based on the demand and market trends, the Noida Authority board approved the decision to reallot the plots under the IT/ITES category. Before adopting the data centre policy in its 208th meeting on Dec 28, 2022, the board had designated these plots for IT/ITES sector. ","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:18 IST","['city', 'noida']",114704263

Tim Scott, the Multnomah County elections director, said that a fire suppressant inside the drop box protected nearly all the ballots, with only three being damaged. His office planned to contact those voters to assist them in obtaining replacement ballots.Later, in Vancouver, located across the Columbia River, television crews captured footage of smoke pouring out of a ballot box at a transit centre.Vancouver is the largest city in Washington's 3rd Congressional District, which is expected to have one of the closest US House races in the country between first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Republican challenger Joe Kent.Greg Kimsey, the Clark County auditor in Vancouver, told The Associated Press that the ballot drop box at the Fisher's Landing Transit Center also had a fire suppression system inside, but for some reason, it wasn't effective. Responders pulled a burning pile of ballots from inside the box, and Kimsey said hundreds were lost. ""Heartbreaking,"" Kimsey said. ""It's a direct attack on democracy.""Surveillance cameras covered the drop box and surrounding area, according to Kimsey. The last ballot pickup at the transit centre drop box was at 11 am Saturday, and anyone who dropped their ballot thereafter that was urged to contact the auditor's office to obtain a new one.Kimsey said the office will be increasing the frequency of ballot collections and changing collection times to the evening to prevent ballot boxes from remaining full overnight when similar crimes are considered more likely to occur.On October 8, an incendiary device was also found on or near a ballot drop box in downtown Vancouver. It did not damage the box or destroy any ballots, according to police. The FBI and other agencies had been investigating.Both Washington and Oregon are vote-by-mail states, where registered voters receive their ballots in the mail a few weeks before elections and then return them by mail or by placing them in ballot drop boxes.Last week in Phoenix, officials reported that approximately five ballots were destroyed and others damaged when a fire was set in a drop box at a US Postal Service station.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:23 IST","['world', 'us']",114704220

Watchman mauled to death by tiger in Uttarakhand’s Udham Singh Nagar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/66-year-old-watchman-killed-by-tiger-in-uttarakhand-shocking-incident-in-terai-central-forest/articleshow/114704259.cms,"  RUDRAPUR: A 65-year-old watchman was mauled to death by a tiger in the Peepal Parav range in Uttarakhand’s Terai Central Forest division late Saturday night.Balveer Singh, a resident of Kopa Kripali village in Gularbhoj, was working along a fellow watchman, Yasin, at a farm near the Bhakra river.The incident came to light on Sunday evening when Balveer’s son, Sonu, arrived at the farm to deliver his father’s meal and found his bed soaked in blood. Alarmed, he notified family members, and they began searching the area. They found Balveer’s mutilated body around 50m away from the farm. His face and parts of his body were reportedly eaten by the tiger. The family identified Balveer from his clothes.Forest officials, including, divisional forest officer (DFO) UC Tiwari, forest ranger Roop Narayan Gautam, and Gularbhoj Police Outpost in-charge Vijender Kumar reached the scene shortly after. ""Prima facie, it appears the watchman was attacked by a tiger,"" said Gautam.The body was sent for postmortem, and the family was provided Rs 15,000 as immediate aid by the forest department. ""The family will be eligible for a compensation of Rs 5 lakh upon submitting the necessary documents,"" Gautam added.Meanwhile, forest department officials attribute the increase in tiger-related incidents in the Terai region due to rising tiger populations and expanding human presence in forest areas.Data reveals that in 2023, tiger attacks claimed 17 lives in the state, and 16 deaths were recorded in 2022. According to the latest tiger census, 53 tigers are present in the Terai Eastern Forest division, 52 in the Terai Western, and eight in the Terai Central Forest division.Chief forest conservator of Kumaon, Dheeraj Pandey, said that there is a need for vigilance by the forest department and the local community, especially during the winter season when tiger attacks tend to increase.“People should stay alert and immediately inform the forest department if they observe tiger or leopard activity nearby,” said Pandey. He added, “Our quick response team (QRT) remains on standby and, if necessary, can remove a tiger from high-risk areas. Residents are urged to avoid venturing deep into the forest and stay cautious.”"," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 12:34 IST","['city', 'dehradun']",114704259
"Defunct smog guns, waste heaps: How Noida is tackling air pollution",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/noidas-ongoing-battle-against-air-pollution-uncovering-defunct-smog-guns-and-waste-aplenty/articleshow/114704286.cms,"  Noida: The air quality in Noida has been fluctuating between ‘poor' and ‘very poor' categories and is likely to reach ‘severe' levels by the end of the week. Despite claims by the pollution department and Noida Authority about enforcing GRAP norms, mounds of dirt left in empty lots, or simply dumped at the roadside, and uncovered construction material are a common sight across the city.On Monday, TOI found half-covered piles of rubble spilling out on to the pavement between Botanical Garden metro station and GIP Mall. Though green drapes have been put up by the contractor appointed by Noida Authority to dismantle the pathway, these are patchy, hardly enough to keep the wind from whipping dust out into the road. People navigating the stretch — many of them seen using handkerchiefs to cover their face — said the dust leaves them choking.In Sector 37, dry leaves and garbage were found heaped outside a park. It appeared the sanitation workers had swept the spot and left the garbage at the spot, in contravention of the stage 2 of the graded response action plan that requires proper disposal of garbage and dust collected in designated sites or landfills.An uncovered pile of sand was spotted outside Golf City in Sector 75. With the road in the area not cleaned for a long time, dust flew with each passing vehicle. Multiple potholes near Sector 51 metro station also kicked up dust in the area.The dust control and mitigation measures under GRAP Stage 2 require water to be sprinkled and dust suppressants used at least every alternate day, during non-peak hours, on roads to arrest road dust, especially at hotspots, heavy traffic corridors and vulnerable areas.When approached, Noida Authority's deputy general manager (civil) Vijay Rawal said there is a project to develop 22 kiosks and a parking facility near GIP mall. ""The project was to be completed in five to six months. As the pollution level increased, we stopped the construction work and put green net on the debris. We will sprinkle water and ensure GRAP compliance,"" he said.The Authority also asserted that its 45 tankers sprinkle treated sewage plant (STP) water across 150 km of roads and 12 mechanical sweeping machines cover 350 km of roads regularly. It said 38 anti-smog guns are currently operational at various sites. But when TOI visited an area near City Centre metro station, it found the anti-smog gun non-functional, and the sidewalks covered with dust and tree leaves. At another spot — a construction site for a mall in Sector 50 — only one anti-smog gun was found operational instead of two.TOI also noted construction activities at multiple sites in the 7X sectors. The city's construction sites are an outsized contributor to the foul air that doctors warn is making the air hazardous, particularly for children and the elderly.While GRAP Stage 2, which is currently in force, permits construction and demolition activities, but it requires the local authorities to inspect them to ensure strict enforcement of dust control measures.UPPCB regional officer (Noida) Utsav Sharma said the pollution department was conducting enforcement drives to ensure compliance with pollution control norms. ""Every day we conduct drives and fine 5-10 violators. We will expedite the drive, especially at construction sites. However, deploying anti-smog guns comes under Noida Authority's purview,"" he said.Noida's deputy general manager (health) SP Singh said ""we have directed our officials to look into the matter and take action.""

Shweta expressed her belief that parents can’t be true friends with their kids, sparking a fun debate. Jaya and Navya playfully disagreed, leading to an exchange that quickly went viral on social media, resonating with listeners everywhere.Shweta shared her perspective on the idea of parents being friends with their children. She expressed that while she loves her children, she keeps a clear boundary, believing there are topics meant just for friends, not for children. Shweta questioned why so many people claim their kids as ""best friends,"" suggesting a preference for a traditional parent-child relationship.Jaya shared a different view, responding that children can indeed become friends with their parents as they grow older. She suggested that friendship can develop over time. Shweta disagreed, emphasizing that there’s always a “parent” role, and she might find it challenging to fully accept advice from her kids, as she would naturally think, “You’re my child, what do you know?”Navya chimed in, pointing out that both Shweta and Jaya are now parents, suggesting that they could bond as friends. Shweta quickly dismissed the idea, stating that she doesn’t see her mother as a friend. She explained that certain boundaries exist in their relationship, emphasizing that friends provide a break from family, creating an alternate family dynamic.Navya argued that family members can also be friends, a sentiment Jaya supported. However, Shweta disagreed, asserting that just because they spend time together doesn’t mean Navya can be completely honest with Jaya. Jaya maintained that she values honesty in her friendship with Navya, but Shweta remained firm in her belief that the parent-child dynamic creates necessary boundaries.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:02 IST","['entertainment', 'hindi', 'bollywood', 'news']",114703092

On the eve of World Stroke Day, experts like Dr Sudhir Shah highlight the growing importance of addressing environmental factors, such as air pollution and stress, to prevent this silent killer.Dr Shah, a senior neurologist who was conferred Padma Shri in 2016 for his contribution to the medical field, said, ""While traditional risk factors remain important, we must also consider the impact of pollution, infection and stress. Studies, such as those conducted by the University of Edinburgh, have linked increased air pollution, particularly PM2.5, to a higher risk of stroke. This is due to the impact of compounds such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide on epithelial cells. These harmful pollutants can trigger inflammation and contribute to conditions like atherosclerosis.""He added that individuals with a history of viral or bacterial infections may also be more susceptible to stroke. ""Furthermore, the pervasive influence of stress, leading to hypertension and other cardiovascular issues, cannot be overlooked. What we do not see is the impact of prolonged mobile phone use and addictions,"" added Dr Shah.Dr Shah said that about 70% of stroke cases can be prevented with a balanced diet, balanced lifestyle and preventive medication. ""One must regularly monitor blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Regular medication can prevent complications. There should also be an emphasis on public infrastructure for activities such as light exercises and meditation to reduce stress,"" he said.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:06 IST","['city', 'ahmedabad']",114703716

Delhi HC backs employees in TDS deposit case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-hc-backs-employees-in-tds-deposit-case/articleshow/114704352.cms,"  MUMBAI: A recent decision of the Delhi high court will support employees of errant companies who are facing income tax (I-T) demand notices, sometimes running into several lakhs, because the employer company has deducted tax at source (TDS) against their salary but not deposited it with govt.The Delhi high court in the case of a pilot formerly employed with the defunct Kingfisher Airlines held that neither can the tax demand be recovered from the employer nor can the same be adjusted against future I-T refunds due to such employee.From time to time, news of tax notices being served on employees makes headlines - be it the case of Kingfisher or the more recent case of Byju's, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings.The high court ruled in favour of former Kingfisher co-pilot Satwant Singh Sanghera, who filed the petition after receiving a notice of an outstanding tax demand totalling over Rs 11 lakh and covering two assessment years. The notice, issued under section 245 of the I-T Act, demanded the unpaid tax amount, plus interest. Sanghera contended that the tax had been deducted from his salary by the airline and was reflected in his Form 16A (given by the employer) but was not remitted to govt.In his defense, Sanghera's counsel argued that under Section 205 of the I-T Act, the tax authority is barred from recovering TDS from employees if the employer has already deducted it. He further cited a 2015 directive from the Central Board of Direct Taxes, which reiterates that TDS should not be recovered from individuals in such instances. Chartered accountant Ketan Vajani said, ""The judiciary has been consistently holding that no amount can be recovered from the deductees (which, in the ITAT's case, is the employee from whose salary the tax has been deducted). However, the difficulty arises as the entry for the tax deducted does not appear in Form 26AS unless the deductor (eg: the employer) pays the TDS to govt and files the TDS returns... This in turn results in tax demands or reduced refunds in the hands of the deductees. All taxpayers cannot afford to knock on the doors of the court. The CBDT should look into this practical difficulty and take remedial steps.""In this case, the Delhi high court ordered the I-T authorities to rescind the disputed demands and process any refunds due. The ruling reaffirms protections for employees in cases where employers fail to remit deducted taxes."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 00:25 IST",['india'],114704352

Operational deficiencies haunt Athikadavu-Avinashi scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/athikadavu-avinashi-scheme-faces-operational-setbacks-amid-equipment-theft-and-mismanagement/articleshow/114704065.cms," 123 Coimbatore: It was in August this year when chief minister M K Stalin inaugurated the Athikadavu-Avinashi groundwater recharge and drinking water supply project after a long wait. Much to the disappointment of farmers and NGOs, water supply is being interrupted with miscreants stealing various project equipment and electricity officials failing to schedule maintenance work at the six pumping stations simultaneously.Pointing to the operational deficiencies, the farmers and NGOs said the same was causing loss to the state exchequer and urged the state govt to implement critical emergency measures to make things right.The scheme, which diverts 1.5 thousand million cubic feet of surplus water from the downstream of Kalingarayan anicut across the Bhavani river to 1,045 waterbodies across Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode districts, was completed at a cost of Rs1,916.41 crore.P K Selvaraj, founder, Kousika Neerkarangal, said the outlet management systems, which were used to monitor and control water flow to waterbodies, were installed in open places, making them vulnerable to theft and unauthorized operation. ""At Vaiyamapalayam check dam in Coimbatore, solar control panels, battery and valves were stolen. Those items are yet to be replaced with new ones. Because of this, water supply is hit. The outlet management systems should be protected by installing a fence around them.""Vetrivel, coordinator, Kousika Neerkarangal, said the lack of additional ground valves was leading to water loss whenever a pipeline was damaged. ""The route map of the pipeline isn't provided to the local bodies or the highways department, leading to accidental pipeline damage during road maintenance. The absence of outlet valves before pipeline diameter transitions often leads to blockages, disrupting water flow.""At Kulathupalayam, he said, the panchayat had damaged the Athikadavu scheme pipeline without knowing that the pipe was laid there. ""It took a day to rectify the damage. In Moperipalayam and Kittampalayam alone, pipes were damaged in 10 places. A gate valve was stolen at Kittamalayam and air valves were stolen at Ganapathipalayam and Papampatti, leading to pipeline leakage and disruption in water supply.""Short-staffed, the Water Resources Department is also not in a position to oversee the running of the project, says another source.A farmer from Agarakarasamakulam, meanwhile called for the formation of an inclusive committee, comprising govt authorities, beneficiaries and all stakeholders. ""Conflicting EB maintenance schedules at the six pumping stations affect the scheme to a large extent.Another farmer, Balakrishnan, of Rayarpalayam, said the scheme had to be fully utilized whenever surplus water was available as it is planned to supply water for only 70 days a year.

Why non-duty paid liquor hurts T revenue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/impact-of-non-duty-paid-liquor-on-telangana-revenue-an-in-depth-analysis/articleshow/114704370.cms,"  Why are NDPL regulations in place in state?Non-Duty Paid Liquor is classified based on VAT and excise duty. The state govt collects both these taxes on every bottle produced and sold within the state, which adds to its revenue. However, if a consumer brings liquor from another state, it falls under NDPL category. The local government then loses out on revenue, which is why regulations are in place to curb NDPL.How do officials check for it?There exists a system whereby officials can verify, using a mobile scanning application, whether a bottle has been supplied to local wine shops from the depots of the Telangana State Beverages Corporation. Holograms on the bottles assist in this verification process. Liquor from other states is also often sold at lower prices, prompting many to attempt to bring it into the state.Are there authorised brands of liquor? The state has authorised over 1,000 brands of liquor. These brands may be produced in distilleries in state or outside, provided the companies obtain permission from the state government to produce them externally.How is NDPL different from illegal liquor?If a consumer purchases liquor that is permitted in the state, but sourced from another state, it constitutes NDPL case. However, illegal liquor is when it is produced within in state, but not in authorised distilleries, where the quality of the liquor is compromised.Any recent cases in Telangana?Event managers and racketeers frequently source liquor from other states to provide for events and their regular clientele. In fact recently, the excise department seized 470 bottles of beer valued at 12 lakh that were being transported from Goa to Telangana.

Gold is now hovering near its life-high in the domestic and international markets.After gold's surge to its all-time high of $2,759 per ounce on Oct 23 in the international markets, it has been hovering above the $2,700 level since. In Mumbai's spot markets, it was at about Rs 79,500-per-10 gram.In comparison, it was at about the Rs 62,000 level last Dhanteras.Though gold prices have softened a bit since last week's record, the current high prices have left jewellers worried about a drop in sales this year compared to 2023.According to Avinash Gupta, director at the All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council, the unprecedented rise in bullion prices is expected to dampen festive demand. ""Every year, there is a visible Dhanteras rush before the auspicious day as people come to make bookings. (This year) that rush is missing."" Gupta said that this year, demand is high for gold jewellery with lower ticket sizes, those priced below Rs 1 lakh. ""We expect token buying this Dhanteras and Diwali. Sales are expected to be lower by at least 20%,"" he added. The yellow metal's high-price situation has prompted jewellery players to add some sweeteners to coax buyers to walk into showrooms.Become an Excel Pro in 2024!

"Denied tickets, several senior politicians in Maharashtra join poll fray as independents",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/maharashtra-politicians-defy-party-lines-contest-elections-as-independents/articleshow/114704435.cms,"  Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar/Nashik: Several senior politicians, failing to get the official candidature from their parties, are set to contest the polls as independents.In Nashik division alone, at least six former MPs and MLAs have filed their nominations as independents for the assembly elections. In Marathwada, five-time former MLA Madhukarrao Chavan will file his nomination papers for the Tuljapur assembly constituency as an independent candidate on Tuesday. The major names from the Nashik division, who filed their nominations as independents, include BJP's former Nandurbar MP Heena Gavit, who filed her papers from Akkalkuwa, former Nashik MP Sameer Bhujbal from Nandgaon, and former Igatpuri MLA Nirmala Gavit from the Igatpuri constituency. Others who filed nominations are former MLA Shirish Chaudhary from Amalner, former MLA Asif Shaikh from Malegaon Central, and former Jalgaon MP AT Nana Patil from Erandol. All the former elected representatives were interested in tickets from their parties. However, their parties chose other candidates or, as part of an alliance, the seat went to another party. These former representatives decided to contest the elections as independents.According to former MP Heena Gavit, she has been very active in the Akkalkuwa assembly constituency, one of the remotest areas of the tribal-dominated Nandurbar district, which is part of the Nandurbar parliamentary constituency. ""This has been a very neglected assembly constituency for years. During my two terms as MP, I always helped the people in this region by constructing roads, bridges, ensuring power connections, water supply systems, and infusing funds for other infrastructure for agriculture, and providing benefits to people under various schemes,"" she claimed.""This is the reason I filed the nomination from the constituency. Shiv Sena nominated MLC Amsha Padavi from the constituency, whose term has just begun. Since there is no other candidate, he was given the ticket, and I am hopeful that BJP will provide me with the party recommendation to contest in this constituency,"" said Gavit, who has also filed her candidature as a BJP nominee.Former MP Sameer Bhujbal said he filed his nomination from Nandgaon, stating that he wanted to end the reign of terror in the Nandgaon assembly constituency. Sitting MLA Suhas Kande was elected in 2019 on a Shiv Sena ticket, and Mahayuti renominated him from the constituency.""People here are living under a reign of terror, and I am contesting the election to help people feel free. The assembly constituency also lacks development. I am sure people will choose me as their representative,"" said Sameer Bhujbal. Meanwhile, five-time former MLA Madhukarrao Chavan, who is 88 years old, is said to have reached out to Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange seeking his support. Congress has named advocate Dhiraj Kadam Patil, who is the party's district president, as the official candidate from Tuljapur. Insiders said Chavan's advanced age was the reason why the party gave the ticket to a younger candidate.Chavan, however, said his supporters were upset with the party's decision and wanted him to contest the assembly elections as an independent. As a result, Chavan collected two forms to file his nomination. He will be submitting the forms on Tuesday.In 2019, Chavan lost the election to BJP's Ranajagjitsinha Patil by over 23,000 votes. Chavan, who was once a wrestler, is known for his connection with the masses at the grassroots level. He was first elected as an MLA in 1990. In the 1995 assembly elections, he lost to Shekari Kamgar Party's Manikrao Khaple. Recovering from the loss, Chavan contested and won four consecutive assembly elections from Tuljapur. Earlier in his political career, Chavan had contested, and lost, an election to NCP's Padamsinh Patil. If he contests, it will be Chavan's ninth time in the assembly election fray.Chavan started his political journey as a party worker and soon contested and won panchayat samiti elections over four decades ago. This was followed by contesting and getting elected as chairman of different banks in Dharasvhi district, including the district central cooperative bank. During Congress govt's tenure, he served as dairy development and animal husbandry minister, apart from serving as deputy speaker of the state assembly.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:27 IST","['city', 'aurangabad']",114704435

"Shendge-led OBC Bahujan Aghadi fields 20 candidates, including 10 in Marathwada",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/obc-bahujan-aghadi-targets-obc-voters-in-maharashtra-elections-with-20-candidates/articleshow/114704437.cms,"  Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar: Prakashanna Shendge-led OBC Bahujan Aghadi on Monday announced its initial list of 20 candidates for the Maharashtra assembly elections, with a significant focus on the Marathwada region. The move is being seen by many as a counter to Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange's decision to field candidates backed by him.The list of candidates reflects the OBC Aghadi's aim to capture a larger share of the OBC voter base, which traditionally leans towards BJP. The group's opposition to the inclusion of the Maratha community in the OBC reservation pool has amplified its presence among voters concerned with reservation policies.The OBC Aghadi, positioning itself as a defender of OBC interests, has fielded 10 candidates from the Marathwada region alone, indicating its regional strategy. The lineup includes three candidates from Nanded district — Nagnath Ghisewad from Bhokar, Chandrasen Patil from Loha, and Hanumantrao Wanlekar from Nayegaon. In Parbhani, the Aghadi selected Vitthal Rabdade for the Gangakhed assembly constituency. In Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Syed Moinuddin will contest from Kannad, while Balu Janrao will represent the Aghadi in Vaijapur. Additional candidates in the region include Parmeshwar Waghmode from Beed district's Gevrai constituency and Anil Goyekar from Latur rural. In Ahmedpur, the Aghadi named Riyaz Ahmed Sidduqi, while Sachin Shendge will run from the Tuljapur constituency in Dharashiv district.The remaining 10 candidates are set to contest from constituencies across Buldhana, Washim, Nagpur, Mumbai, Nashik and Solapur, expanding the Aghadi's influence beyond Marathwada. With this list, the Shendge-led front intensifies the competition in an already crowded electoral field, likely impacting the traditional vote banks of other political factions. Analysts said the entry of OBC Bahujan Aghadi candidates could potentially alter voting dynamics, particularly among OBC communities in the state, and may tilt the results due to its considerable percentage of electors in certain constituencies.

Kishor Jorgewar, who contested as an Independent candidate from Chandrapur (SC) in 2019 and won, recently joined BJP and was given the ticket from this constituency.BJP has fielded Harish Pimple from Murtizapur (SC), Rajesh Wankhade from Teosa, Umesh Yawalkar from Morshi, Charansing Thakur from Katol, Ashish Deshmukh from Savner, Pravin Datke from Nagpur Central, Sudhakar Kohale from Nagpur West, Milind Mane from Nagpur North, Avinash Brahmankar from Sakoli, Raju Todsam from Arni (ST), Kishan Wankhede from Umarkhed (SC), Jitesh Antapurkar from Deglur (SC), Suresh Dhas from Ashti, Archana Chakurkar from Latur City, Ram Satpute from Malshiras (SC), Manoj Ghorpade from Karad North, and Sangram Deshmukh from Palus-Kadegaon.Sources said the delay in announcing the third list was to ensure those planning to stand as rebels do not have much time to file their nominations. So far, BJP has announced candidates for 147 assembly seats. In 2019, BJP, along with its allies, contested 164 seats, while the undivided Shiv Sena contested 124 seats.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:27 IST","['city', 'mumbai']",114704439

In 2014, Tanwani had contested the poll on a BJP ticket against Shiv Sena's Pradeep Jaiswal and AIMIM's Imitiaz Jaleel won the seat.Maharashtra Legislative Council's leader of opposition Ambadas Danve said Tanwani was removed from the post of the party's district president. In 2019 too, Tanwani had backed out of the contest to support Jaiswal. Shiv Sena (UBT) had announced Tanwani's name in the first list of its candidates seven days ago and also gave him A & B forms. Tanwani was scheduled to file his nomination on Tuesday, the last day of filing papers for the Nov 20 assembly elections.""In 2014, I contested the poll as a BJP candidate and Jaiswal was in the fray as the Shiv Sena nominee. The result was AIMIM's Syed Imtiaz Jaleel won the elections. The current situation is in no way different. I informed party chief Uddhav Thackeray about my decision to quit the contest, so that the AIMIM candidate does not win,"" Tanwani told TOI.In the 2014 assembly elections, Jaiswal got 41,861 votes, Tanwani 40,770 and Jaleel won with 61,843 votes. In 2019, Jaiswal had contested the election on a Sena ticket and defeated AIMIM's Siddiqui by 13,892 votes.""In the 2019 assembly elections, there was a similar situation and AIMIM could have won. I had withdrawn my form and supported Jaiswal to win the elections. I was expecting that Jaiswal would reciprocate the courtesy I had shown him by supporting me in the 2024 assembly elections, But he did not do so,"" Tanwani said, adding that he would work hard to ensure Thorat's victory.Tanwani, who served as Mhada's chairman from 1996 to 1999, went on to become a corporator in 2000 and again in 2005. He became the mayor of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in the second term. Before the term ended, he successfully contested the MLC elections as the party's official candidate. During the 2014 assembly elections, he was denied a ticket by Sena, following which he switched over to BJP. He contested assembly elections against his decades-long friend Jaiswal, and both of them lost in 2014.Besides Jaiswal and Thorat, MNS's Suhas Dashrathe, VBA's Javeed Qureshi and Naseeruddin Siddiqui of AIMIM are now in the fray for the seat.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:25 IST","['city', 'aurangabad']",114704393

Director Suri was very particular about it, which made me sign the project,” she tells us about the movie, which is releasing on October 31. Ask her about working with Sriimurali, and she replies, “It was incredible to work with him. Even though he has a very demanding schedule of his own — including constantly building his body and being on diet — he brought in positive energy on the sets; it was infectious. At the same time, I was also happy that I could eat some carbs.”  Rukmini, who recently ventured into Tamil movies, shares, “I feel really blessed and am fortunate to do these kinds of projects. Each film has helped me to grow and become a better actor. That’s the beauty of portraying different roles and working with different teams.” As for working in different languages, Rukmini adds, “Our performance and expressions have no language barriers; I think it is universal. While navigating across industries, I ensure I learn the language and communicate accurately. The opportunities across the South have made me work with many talented people.” What is her thought process while choosing roles? “Primarily, I look at the character in the entirety of the script, because nobody watches a character in isolation. My role should contribute to the overall narrative. At the same time, I want to collaborate with wonderful teams — actors, technicians and production houses — as I continue with my learning curve,” says Rukmini, who has two back-to-back releases in Kannada. “Yes, Bhairathi Ranagal is also releasing. I have been working on these two projects for a long time. It’s a coincidence that they are releasing within a short span. As an actor, I am trying to maintain the same energy in every film of mine,” she says.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:00 IST","['entertainment', 'kannada', 'movies', 'news']",114687715

But sources said the realtor, which maintains areas near Golf Course, plans to install temporary barricades to mitigate the risk of accidents and slow down traffic on the stretch. ""The company will take up the matter with GMDA to determine the best course of action regarding the unmarked speed breaker, whether it should be removed or maintained with appropriate markings to enhance visibility till a permanent solution is worked out,"" the source added. The GMDA official said that the authority was tasked to build the tabletop crossing by the District Road Safety Committee, which had approved its construction in April after a pedestrian was killed by a speeding vehicle on the stretch. This raised pedestrian crossing, called a tabletop crossing, is designed to slow down vehicles and make it more visible to commuters.But the one on Golf Course Road does not have the markings of a zebra crossing along with other safety features such as road studs, cat eyes, and cautionary signage. Golf Course Road has long been plagued by speeding, with vehicles often seen cruising beyond 100kmph, well above the limits of 60kmph on surface roads and 50kmph on underpasses.Over the past three years, the stretch near La Lagune has seen seven crashes, three fatalities and four serious injuries, mainly due to speeding."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 09:30 IST","['city', 'gurgaon']",114704293

"These hsg societies show how recycling can help city, and also back social causes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurgaons-innovative-housing-societies-lead-the-way-in-recycling-and-community-support/articleshow/114704447.cms,"  Gurgaon: When the most successful business models rest on it, why can't a civic problem everyone is struggling to solve?If the city is to get past the garbage problem that besieges it, it will have to look beyond template, one that has anyway not worked. It'll have to innovate.And so, in this campaign where we have tried to put in the public domain all the best ideas and practices that different societies in the city have come up with to manage household waste better, we thought we would highlight innovation in waste management as a separate category.After our jury assessed more than 100 entries we received and made physical visits to societies to rank them, we have the three best practices in the innovation in waste management segment — Central Park, Hamilton Court and DLF Belaire.This is the third category we are announcing today after best waste segregation practices and outstanding compost initiative. In the coming days, we will also announce who the best performers are in the environmental impact and sustainability category.Innovations in waste management are essential for creating sustainable cities and reducing the environmental impact of garbage. What better example than Gurgaon, which has ended up with a landfill in the Aravalis, which contaminates the ecology and often sends streams of copious leachate into the surroundings. Locals in Bandhwari have for years complained of health problems.Central Park has perhaps the best recycling example, largely cutting down on the waste it needs to send out of the compound for processing at a landfill. The RWA here uses an electrical shredder to cut horticulture waste and make inhouse organic manure for gardens and use by residents. ""We relocated 10-15 large boulders lying discarded since 2005. In 2022 a crane lifted and relocated these as decorative rockeries and landscape features within the green spaces. Basement workstations of support staff have been upgraded with new and many old pieces of furniture discarded by residents. Through recycling and redesigning by inhouse carpenters, new cupboards, lockers, tables, etc have been built,"" said Amita Sarwal, RWA member and portfolio in-charge, horticulture and miscellaneous projects, at Central Park 1.Hamilton Court's RWA has started a unique initiative to recycle paper. ""We launched a project named Firki, which was on waste paper management. We requested residents to segregate paper waste and not to throw it in the regular bin. We gave them bags because we need huge bags to keep paper. So people started throwing everything which is paper there. Once a month, collection was done. The paper was weighed and sent to recycling and in return for that paper, we got notebooks. And we started giving those notebooks to schools and NGOs, schools where parents didn't have money to buy notebooks for the kids,"" said RWA member Shelly Khanna. Proactive measures like these can be a model for other communities to follow. Teamwork is key. One piece of paper, for example, won't make a difference. But one every day, done by many, will bring in sweeping change. ","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:27 IST","['city', 'gurgaon']",114704447
Bargain hunting reverses sensex's five-session slide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bargain-hunting-reverses-sensexs-five-session-slide/articleshow/114704466.cms,"  MUMBAI: Bargain hunting on Dalal Street after the sensex slid for five days lifted it by 603 points or 0.8% to 80,005 points on Monday. While ICICI Bank led the rally on the back of a strong set of quarterly numbers, foreign fund selling late in the session limited gains after the index was up more than 1,100 points during mid-session.Restricted air strikes by Israel over the weekend on select military installations in Iran also prompted global investors to speculate about non-escalation of hostilities between the two West Asian nations. This, in turn, led to a slide in the prices of crude oil - the biggest import item for India - which helped the rupee strengthen a bit. Crude price on the NYMEX tanked nearly 6% in early trades on Monday, while the rupee ended 5 paise up at 84.05 against the dollar.On the NSE, too, Nifty rallied strongly and closed 158 points or 0.7% up at 24,339 points. In Monday's session, both Nifty and the sensex reversed their five-session losing streaks.The market's Monday gains were ""supported by a fall in crude oil prices... after Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran over the weekend bypassed Iranian oil and nuclear facilities, and did not disrupt energy supplies,"" Siddhartha Khemka, head of research (wealth management) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said. Continuing with Oct's trend of selling in secondary market, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 3,228 crore on Monday too. On the other hand, domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 1,401 crore. The day's session added about Rs 3.7 lakh crore to investors' wealth.Become an Excel Pro in 2024!

On Monday afternoon, cops received an SOS from locals of Blinds Colony in Nagole. A Surya Nayak, Nagole SHO, along with his team rushed to the spot following the alert.

Nagpur’s Electoral Battle Heats Up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nagpur-elections-2023-key-battles-and-candidate-showdowns/articleshow/114703879.cms,"  With BJP releasing its third list, Mahayuti and MVA contenders are finalised across all seats of Nagpur city. BJP and Congress are engaged in major battles across all six constituencies, except in East. In 2019, BJP won on four seats while Congress won two. In 2014, BJP swept all six seats thanks to Modi wave. This time, the contest will be tough as indicated during LS polls. TOI's Vaibhav Ganjapure, Abhishek Choudhari and Proshun Chakraborty take a look at big fights between candidates of both mega alliancesNagpur SouthwestA rerun of the 2014 battle Devendra Fadnavis (BJP) vs Praful Gudadhe (Cong)Unlike the remaining 11 assembly constituencies in the district, there was no ambiguity in both Mahayuti and Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) over Nagpur Southwest. In fact, TOI had first reported on June 29, quoting Praful Gudadhe, that the senior Congress corporator would challenge deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis here. Gudadhe had been planning for the past couple of years. Former home minister of Maharashtra, Anil Deshmukh, too had declared that if his party, NCP (Sharad Pawar), granted permission, he would confront Fadnavis. However, Congress opposed any such moves. Gudadhe and Fadnavis had first confronted each other in Nagpur Southwest in 2014. Fadnavis defeated Guddadhe with a substantial margin of 58,942 votes in 2014 and in 2019 triumphed over then Congress candidate Ashish Deshmukh by 49,344 votes. In 2009, Fadnavis had defeated Congress city president Vikas Thakre by 27,775 votes. While Fadnavis is seeking his fourth term from the seat and sixth overall, Gudadhe is striving to enter the state legislature for the first time relying on various factors, including anti-incumbency sentiment. The constituency spans a vast area, including Mihan.+++++++++++ Nagpur SouthOnly 4,000 votes and 5 years later...Mohan Mate (BJP) Vs Girish Pandav (Cong)Congress overcame a strong claim by its MVA ally Shiv Sena (UBT) for the seat. The war of words between Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut and MPCC president Nana Patole escalated to a point that strained ties between the two parties. Intervention by senior netas, along with NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar, led to a truce resulting in Sena securing Ramtek and Congress Nagpur South. The constituency would be seeing a repeat of the 2019 contest, when sitting BJP MLA Mohan Mate defeated Congress candidate Girish Pandav by just over 4,000 votes. Mate, who had first won the seat in 1999, is aspiring for his third term, while Pandav is likely to rake up anti-incumbency and other issues. The seat has been with BJP since 2014 when the party's current district president Sudhakar Kohale defeated Congress stalwart and former guardian minister Satish Chaturvedi by over 43,000 votes. Govindrao Wanjari of Congress had won the seat in 2004 but his untimely demise led to by-polls in 2005, when Congress' Dinanth Padole emerged the winner. Padole retained the seat in 2009. ++++++++++++++++++ Nagpur WestInternal conflicts prelude main contest Sudhakar Kohale (BJP) Vs Vikas Thakre (Congress)While smaller parties with limited sway have also entered the fray, the primary battle appears to be between BJP's former MLA Sudhakar Kohale and Congress' sitting MLA Vikas Thakre. The entry of Narendra Jichkar, who was suspended from Congress, into the electoral fray as an Independent has added another political dimension to the fight. Nagpur West, once a Congress bastion, was seized by BJP in 1990 and remained under its control until Thakre's triumph in 2019. This time, Thakre faced challenges from within the party after former corporator Kamlesh Chowdhary, considered a close confidant of Congress leader Sunil Kedar, publicly endorsed Jichkar. The intra-party rivalry has set the stage for a high-stakes showdown in Nagpur West. Meanwhile, BJP is grappling with discontentment among North Indians, having a substantial population in the constituency, who had called for a representative from their community. They threatened to opt for NOTA (None of the Above) option in protest, posing an additional challenge for BJP in this fiercely contested seat.+++++++++++++++++++++ Nagpur CentralAs complicated as it can getPravin Datke (BJP) Vs Bunty Shelke (Congress)BJP, which scored a hat-trick of wins in the constituency in 2019, seems locked in a close contest withj Congress. While Bunty Shelke, runner-up in 2019, is again the Congress candidate, BJP has opted for MLC and former mayor Pravin Datke. In an unexpected turn, former Congress MLA and ex-minister Anees Ahmed resigned from Congress to join the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA). Ahmed, poised to file his nomination on Tuesday, is expected to dig into Muslim votes of Congress. Another distinctive feature of the contest is both BJP and Congress not nominating candidates from the Halba community, prompting the community members to contemplate fielding an independent candidate. Prominent figures within the BJP from the Halba community, including three-time corporator Pravin Bhisikar and former deputy mayor Deepraj Pardikar, known to be close to RSS, have expressed interest. In Congress, Nanda Parate, city president of Congress women's wing, and four-time corporator Ramesh Punekar too sought tickets. Punekar threatened to fight as an independent while Parate, a West Nagpur resident, aims to leverage her Halba background. Should the Halba community resolve to field an independent candidate, it would complicate the race for both the BJP and Congress.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Nagpur EastA saffron stronghold since 2009 Krishna Khopde (BJP) Vs Duneshwar Pethe (NCP- Sharad Pawar)This is the sole seat in Nagpur city which Congress conceded to an ally, in this instance, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar). MVA candidate Duneshwar Pethe, a former corporator, would challenge BJP veteran Krishna Khopde, who has transformed this constituency into a saffron stronghold. Khopde has been wining the seat since 2009, and each time, he secured more than 50% of the vote share. This constituency also accounts for the maximum number of corporators for BJP, demonstrating its strong presence at the grass roots level. BJP is relying on development initiatives undertaken in the area. The most recent projects included those to alleviate drinking water problems and development of roads, among others. For MVA, this is going to be an arduous task, not only due to Khopde's influence in the area but also because of internal strife. Discontent brews among Congress netas who feel the party brass allocated the seat to NCP (SP) despite having numerous aspirants within its own ranks. NCP (SP) will have to put in a colossal effort and initiate ground-level mobilisation to pull off a victory in this constituency.* Nagpur NorthScore tied at 1-1, who will surge ahead?Milind Mane (BJP) versus Nitin Raut (Congress)The long-standing electoral adversaries are set for a third face-off, with the scores tied at 1-1. In 2014, Milind Mane emerged victorious from the constituency which former minister Nitin Raut won in 2019. Nagpur North is the sole constituency in Nagpur city that is reserved for an SC candidate. Raut has been active in the party since the 1970s, and has worked his way up the ranks. Raut is well-versed in the social dynamics and will endeavour to plan his campaign accordingly. His son Kunal is president of Maharashtra Youth Congress. For Mane, the support of party cadres and development work undertaken by BJP brass in the area will be the main poll plank. Additionally, the regularisation of nazul plots in this constituency, something which the BJP pursued aggressively, may appeal to voters. Nagpur North is unique considering it has voters from all communities, including Buddhists, Christians, Sikhs and Muslims. While Congress and BJP have dedicated vote banks here, the third factor is Mayawati's BSP which consistently draws considerable votes impacting fortunes of other parties. Congress would want to capitalise on the momentum gained the post-Lok Sabha polls. BJP is hoping its work and candidates from other secular parties will propel it past the finishing line.

The second public hearing will be in Nizamabad on Tuesday.The BC associations also demanded an increase in BC quota to 42% in education and employment as promised by the Congress in its BC Declaration at Kamareddy. Some wanted removal of 10% EWS reservations, if needed, to increase their quota.In all, 90 representations were submitted to the commission in the form of affidavits. Over 500 people, including caste association leaders and political leaders attended the meeting.As the ST population is more in Adilabad, they wanted the post of zilla parishad chairman reserved for them. AIMIM leaders from Adilabad submitted a representation urging for inclusion of more Muslim castes in Group-E reservations.""Some BC caste associations such as Mudiraj, among others, wanted their communities to be changed from Group B to Group A and other groups, and a few others urged for inclusion of some in the BC quota. Many demanded that the BC quota be given in the form of BC-A, B, C, D, and E groups as existing, but as per their population. Priority was sought for castes and communities whose population is more but reservation and representation is less in elected bodies, education and govt jobs,"" a source in the commission told TOI. Commission chairman Niranjan said people who missed the public hearing can submit their representations in person or through post at the commission's office at Khairatabad by Nov 13.Some wanted constituti-on of a BC Commission on the lines of SC/ST commission so that it will have judicial powers to act against atrocities on BCs, allocation of 50% of Indiramma houses and 50% of state budget for BCs.Special economic zones, subsidised loans, 50% reservations to women, non-creamy layer certificates to employees were some of the other demands.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:27 IST","['city', 'hyderabad']",114704448

Dhanteras 2024: Gold loses sheen as sky-high rates dampen sale prospects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/gold-prices-soar-dhanteras-sales-plummet-impact-of-high-rates-on-festivities/articleshow/114704477.cms," Every year, there is a visible Dhanteras rush even before the auspicious day as people come in to make bookings, but this year the rush is missing at most showrooms. HYDERABAD: Gold surging past the $2700/ounce mark for the first time on Oct 19, 2024 and remaining embedded over that level ever since with a new lifetime high of $2758.45 on Oct 23 in international spot markets, has left jewellers sweating at the prospect of a lacklustre Dhanteras and Diwali this year. With prices in the Indian market too reigning at over 80,000/10 gm (including taxes) amid the festive season, the industry is apprehensive of a potential 20-30% drop in sales this Dhanteras, which falls on Tuesday. All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council director Avinash Gupta said the industry is expecting at least 20% lower sales than last year due to the unprecedented rise in gold prices. ""Every year, there is a visible Dhanteras rush even before the auspicious day as people come in to make bookings, but this year the rush is missing at most showrooms. Sales could even be impacted by more than 20%,"" he said. ""There are hardly any buyers. Sales are down by 70%. The Dhanteras festive rush is missing because it is not just gold that is at all-time highs; silver too is hovering around 1 lakh per kg. Until the crisis in the Middle East continues, gold will remain high,"" said Anil Jain of M Nemichand Jain Jewellers in Secunderabad's famed Pot Market. Echoing this sentiment, Darshan Gupta, Partner at Mangatrai Jewellers, said the response so far in terms of pre-bookings has been lukewarm. ""The buying sentiment is missing due to high prices, but we expect some token purchases due to the auspicious day. We expect at least 20-30% lower sales compared to last Dhanteras,"" Gupta said. However, PK Siraj, retail head (Rest of India) at Malabar Gold & Diamonds, expressed hope that the upcoming wedding season post-Diwali may come to the rescue of jewellers, despite the festive mood being absent among buyers. ""I am optimistic because there are many marriages coming up, but the mood is not that great as the gold rate is very high,"" he admitted. The Dhanteras sentiment appeared to be dampened despite gold trading at lower levels of $2730 on Monday. ""Gold resumed trading on a weaker note on Monday due to a declining safe haven demand after Israel's attack on Iran was less severe than expected. In international markets, spot gold on Comex was trading at $2730, down $16 from the previous day,"" said Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst - commodities, HDFC Securities.

"26,000 cr for roads, govt mulls PPP route",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/government-allocates-26000-crore-for-road-development-through-ppp/articleshow/114704483.cms,"  Hyderabad: The state govt has proposed to involve private parties for widening, repairs and maintenance of existing roads as well as laying of new roads in rural, semi-urban and urban areas over next four years.This initiative covers a road length of 17,300 km at an estimated cost of over 26,000 crore, including 12,000 crore dedicated to rural roads alone. The govt has proposed to implement this under the public-private partnership mode and also entrust the maintenance of these roads to the same organisation or agency for 10 years. However, as of now, the govt has not proposed collection of toll fee on these roads to reimburse the investment of the private players. Sources in CMO told TOI that a high-level committee would be formed to discuss and hire consultants for the preparation of a detailed project report for the implementation of the project, which includes the 17,000 km accumulated length of roads falling under the panchayat raj, rural development and roads and buildings departments. ""Once the DPR is prepared, clarity will emerge on whether toll will be collected from the motorists using these roads or if the govt would pay back the agencies in the form of allowing advertisements or follow some other model,"" a source said. As part of the project, the govt is proposing to blacktop all the existing roads and lay new ones in every village, including tribal hamlets. In the first phase, rural roads belonging to the panchayat raj department would be developed at the rate of 4,000 km to 5,000 km per year. There is a total road network of 68,539 km under the panchayat raj wing in the state. Of these, 26,146 km are black topped roads, 7,752 km are water-bound macadam roads, 4,146 km are cement concrete roads, and the remaining 30,493 km are dirt roads. Based on the estimated losses after the recent floods and reports from various districts, the govt decided to rehabilitate 17,300 km of roads first. A road from each gram panchayat to mandal centre will be laid, with special focus on road connectivity to villages without dirt roads and metal roads. The capacity of existing rural roads will be increased from 10 metric tonnes to 30 MT. Presently, panchayat raj roads are operated with a vehicle capacity of only 10 MT. ""Over the years, govt has not allocated sufficient funds for the maintenance and rehabilitation of panchayat raj roads. On the other hand, these roads leading to rural areas have been damaged in many places due to continuous heavy rains. Mainly between July and Sept this year, all the roads were washed away due to rains in many districts,"" said an official. ","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:30 IST","['city', 'hyderabad']",114704483

500 CCTVs footage in 200km span helped police crack realtor murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cctv-footage-unveils-shocking-murder-plot-of-realtor-amidst-financial-dispute/articleshow/114704549.cms," 12 Hyderabad: The detection of Hyderabad-based realtor Ramesh Kumar's murder by Kodagu police of Karnataka was result of a thorough analysis of around 500 CCTV cameras spanning a 200-km stretch from Kodagu towards Bengaluru. Ramesh's charred body was found at Panya Estate in Suntikoppa on Oct 8.Investigators told TOI that there were absolutely no clues at the murder spot or on the body to identify the deceased that could lead to the killers. As the estate was in a remote area, clues like vehicle tyre marks were also not available. There were some CCTVs in the surrounding areas, but as they were not in working condition, the cops could not get a breakthrough. There were no missing cases in the district that could relate to the charred body.However, four special teams tasked with identifying the deceased and nabbing his killers started analysing CCTV footage on all routes connecting Suntikoppa, including the Bengaluru highway. Analysis of footage from cameras on the Bengaluru highway a couple of days before the body was found resulted in spotting a car moving suspiciously. With this lead, they worked on other technical aspects and finally caught the accused — Ramesh's third wife P Niharika, 29, her live-in partner Nikhil Maireddy, a Bengaluru-based doctor, and friend Ankul Rana, 30, of Haryana.""We are in the process of collecting more evidence to prove the role of the three accused ,"" said an investigator. A financial dispute between Ramesh and Niharika led to the murder. Kodagu police have informed Rachakonda cops and Ramesh's family members on the murder.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:33 IST","['city', 'hyderabad']",114704549

"Priests clear air, confirm Diwali on Thursday",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/diwali-celebrations-confirmed-for-october-31-by-priests/articleshow/114704488.cms," 123 Hyderabad: Ahead of Diwali, priests have cleared the air as to when Laxmi puja should be celebrated (on Oct 31 or Nov 1). Though the Amavasya thithi spans both Oct 31 and Nov 1, leading to uncertainty on when to celebrate Diwali, they made it clear that the festival should be celebrated on Oct 31. ""Diwali usually lasts for five days. Most people in Telugu states think that Naraka Chaturdasi (the second day of festival) and Laxmi puja (when firecrackers are burst and Laxmi puja performed) combine Diwali festival. But the actual puja and celebrations begin with Dhana trayodashi (Dhanteras), Naraka Chaturdasi, Laxmi puja (which is generally considered major Diwali), Balipratipada puja, and Yama Dwitiya,"" Rajeswar Sharma, a priest, said.  On the day when firecrackers are burst and Laxmi puja is offered, it should coincide with Amavasya thithi, timings of which should encompass the sunset and most of the night on the same day. This time, Amavasya timing fell on two days. On Nov 1, Amavasya concludes at 6.16 pm.On Oct 31, the Amavasya timing starts at 3.52 pm, which will continue during sunset time (unlike on Nov 1). And the entire night will have Amavasya timing which is auspicious to do Laxmi puja and celebrate Diwali,"" Sharma said.In Hindu almanac period following sunset, referred to as ‘Pradosh Kaal', is suitable for conducting Laxmi puja. On Oct 31, this auspicious timeframe is from 5.12 pm to 7.43 pm, making it ideal for the ritual. Conversely, on Nov 1, the Amavasya thithi concludes at 6:16 PM, which shortens the Pradosh Kaal and renders it less favourable for worshipping the goddess, a pandit said.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:31 IST","['city', 'hyderabad']",114704488

CM Eknath Shinde's development work and schemes have had a positive impact in the area, and our party base is sizeable. Raju Parwe will be our candidate for Umred.""Mahayuti has released names for all candidates in Nagpur district, except for Umred, thus making it clear that a struggle is going on between BJP and Shinde Sena.Speaking to TOI, Raju Parwe said, ""I am also waiting to hear from my high command. I am ready to contest if the green signal is given.""TOI also reached out to BJP state president Chandrashekhar Bawankule, but he did not respond to calls or messages.With the last day to file nominations being Tuesday, Mahayuti has no option but to make a tough choice which could mean sparking rebellion from the either side.

The non-availability of buses on their routes has led to a range of issues, including accidents, long walks to school, and even dropouts.One alarming incident occurred recently when a bus lost balance and tipped over due to overcrowding, resulting in students being injured. ""It was a terrifying experience,"" recounted Syeda Sania, a Class 10 student from Vikarabad. ""The bus was already packed, but more people kept boarding. Suddenly, the bus tilted, and we all fell on top of each other. I was badly hurt."" Families who can afford it are resorting to expensive alternatives like autos, which can cost thousands of rupees per month. However, for many students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, this is not an option. ""My parents cannot afford to send me to school by auto every day. I have no choice but to walk, even though it's not safe, especially for girls.""The lack of sufficient buses has also forced many students to walk long distances to reach their schools within ORR limits.

Patole’s Friendly Advice to Raut: Focus on Defeating Mahayuti,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/patole-urges-raut-to-unite-against-bjp-in-maharashtra-elections/articleshow/114704599.cms,"  Nagpur: Nana Patole, Maharashtra Congress president, issued a friendly reminder to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Monday, urging him to prioritize unity within the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) to defeat the BJP-led Mahayuti in the upcoming elections. Patole's statement came in response to Raut's criticism regarding seat allocations for Shiv Sena (UBT), particularly in the Nagpur South constituency, which has been a point of contention within the alliance.Patole acknowledged that the Congress faced similar disappointments in regions like Konkan but emphasized the importance of the MVA's greater mission of preventing Mahayuti's return to power. He expressed concerns that BJP policies could potentially alter Maharashtra's social landscape and reiterated the Congress's commitment to preserving the state's values, which are inspired by prominent figures such as Chhatrapati Shahu, Mahatma Phule, and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar.Addressing speculation about former Congress minister Anees Ahmed possibly joining the VBA, Patole dismissed the rumours and commended Ahmed's loyalty to the party. He also criticized the BJP for alleged mismanagement of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue project in Malvan. Furthermore, Patole acknowledged the limited representation of the Dhangar and Wanjari communities but assured that the MVA would prioritize inclusivity and development for all communities if they come to power.Patole confirmed that the Congress was intensifying its efforts to secure seats like Ramtek with the support of the MVA. He outlined plans to combat inflation and promote policies that would benefit Maharashtra's youth, women, and economically weaker sections. Additionally, Patole criticized the BJP's central leadership, accusing them of having an ""anti-Maharashtra"" stance by blocking crucial projects such as the recent Tata-Airbus plant and the Vedanta-Foxconn project, both of which were relocated to Gujarat. He argued that these decisions demonstrated the BJP's disregard for Maharashtra's economic interests. ","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:37 IST","['city', 'nagpur']",114704599

There should be a permanent solution to it,"" the minister said on the sidelines of the launch of four anti-smog guns mounted on auto-rickshaws in the city.Singh said there are multiple reasons for the increase in pollution. ""In my personal opinion, stubble burning can only impact 4% to 5% as far as controlling rising levels of pollution is concerned. However, I told the officials of the Pollution Control Board in Chandigarh to devise a permanent and lasting solution for it. The Haryana govt accusing the Delhi govt and the Delhi govt accusing the Haryana govt — it shouldn't be like this,"" the minister said.On Oct 20, Delhi CM Atishi criticised Haryana and UP govts, alleging inadequate efforts in tackling the escalating air pollution crisis. She said the BJP-led govts were not acting against stubble burning, the instances of which she claimed are the pollution in the two states.As for the anti-smog guns that were launched on Monday, Singh said, ""This is a trial run. The govt has not spent anything on it. The capacity of the tank is 1,000 litres for spraying water. We will purchase these anti-smog guns after the trial run is successful."" ""We will try to increase the capacity of the tank. Mounting these guns on three-wheelers is beneficial since it can navigate through the narrow lanes,"" he said.

Four anti-smog gun machines were launched on a trial basis on Monday to control dust and pollution in the corporation area, Bangar said. ""These machines can spray water up to 20 meters with a 320-degree cannon rotation. A stainless steel tank with a capacity of 1,000 litres is attached to the machine. The machine's specialty is that it can also reach narrow lanes and markets. The cost of one machine is approximately Rs 18 lakh and the estimated total cost for all four machines is around Rs 72 lakh.

She committed suicide due to this reason and not because she was asked to convert to Christianity.The court was hearing the petition filed by Sister Sagaya Mary, an accused in the case. The petitioner stated that the prosecution's case is that she used to torture the girl by assigning her many hostel tasks, which prevented her from concentrating on her studies and caused her mental stress. Frustrated, she consumed pesticide in Jan 2022.The CBI filed the chargesheet before the chief judicial magistrate in Trichy. The petitioner is the sole accused. The petitioner stated that the allegations in the case are wholly baseless, misconceived, and an abuse of the process of law. There is no prima facie case established against her. There is no statement in any of the four alleged statements of the deceased, produced along with the chargesheet, indicating any specific acts of violence or torture or actions allegedly done by the petitioner with any intention to push the deceased to suicide. Hence, the petitioner moved court seeking to quash the chargesheet filed against her before the mahila court."," Oct 29, 2024, 00:36 IST","['city', 'madurai']",114704593
"Two to tango in Ramtek: Congmen Mulak, Chouksey to contest as independents",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/congressmen-rebel-in-ramtek-elections-mulak-and-chouksey-to-run-as-independents/articleshow/114704639.cms,"  Nagpur/Amravati/Yavatmal/Akola: The fight for Ramtek assembly seat is getting interesting by the day as now two Congressmen are planning to contest as independents, after Shiv Sena (UBT) got the seat within MVA. Former MoS Rajendra Mulak is almost certain to file nomination on Tuesday even as fellow Congressman Chandrapal Chouksey too has decided to give it a shot.The Congress party is unhappy with the Shiv Sena (UBT) for not ceding the seat to them.While Mulak did not respond to calls, Congress leader Rashmi Barve confirmed the development. Barve, whose husband Shyam is the Congress Ramtek MP, said, ""On Tuesday, Mulak saheb will file his papers as independent. With support from our leader Sunil Kedar, we are confident of victory here. Sitting MLA Ashish Jaiswal has failed to bring real change at the ground level and people have also understood that the Mahayuti govt is making false promises to get votes."" But with a second Congressman, Chouksey, in fray, the party has to take care of votes getting cut. Barve said, ""We will talk it out amongst ourselves, since everybody belongs to Congress."" Meanwhile, Chouksey said he won't back down. Speaking to TOI, Chouksey said, ""I was born in Ramtek, this is both my janambhoomi and karm-bhoomi. Why should I withdraw when it would be easier for me to contest and Mulak to withdraw."" Chouksey had contested unsuccesfully from Ramtek in 2004 on a Congress ticket.Rebellions have been a common theme across both Mahayuti and MVA in the run-up to assembly elections, as those denied official tickets are fighting as independents.In Nagpur district, Congress loyalist and former minister Anees Ahmed is the biggest name to switch parties. Similarly, party ex-corporator Tanaji Vanwe filed nomination as an independent from Nagpur East. With Mahayuti yet to decide on the Umred seat, more rebel candidates are expected.Apart from rebellions, ‘friendly fights' are also on the radar of party bosses, as they eat into votes. Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Monday, at Chikli (Buldhana), such friendly fights might happen in a few places. But Fadnavis reassured voters efforts are underway to resolve intra-alliance disputes. AMRAVATINominations were filed by rebel candidates Preeti Band from Badnera (Shiv Sena), Ramesh Bundile from Daryapur (BJP), and independent candidate Nitin Kadam from Badnera, as the party decisions were not to everyone's satisfaction. Late in the evening, BJP veteran and former minister Jagdish Gupta announced his decision to contest from Amravati assembly constituency as an independent candidate, claiming the local BJP unit is not competent enough to provide justice to party workers. Similarly, BJP's Tushar Bhartiya is expected to file nomination as an independent from Badnera, after the seat went to sitting MLA Ravi Rana. In Morshi, a ‘friendly fight' seems to be on the cards between Mahayuti allies — sitting MLA Devendra Bhuyar of NCP (Ajit Pawar faction) and BJP's Umesh Yawalkar, showcasing the alliance's effort to maintain harmony despite conflicting candidates. WASHIM In Washim's Risod Assembly constituency, former minister Anantrao Deshmukh formally submitted his candidacy as the BJP nominee, even though ally Shiv Sena (Shinde) has fielded veteran Bhavana Gawali from the same constituency. This high voltage fight, considering the stature of candidates involved, will be an interesting one but may end up harming Mahayuti's chances. YAVATMALFormer MLA Sandeep Bajoria, a close ally of Sharad Pawar, filed his nomination independently after failing to secure the MVA ticket, which was awarded to the Congress instead. Bajoria's decision to enter the race as both an independent and under the NCP (Sharad) symbol has stirred uncertainty within the alliance, leaving MVA leaders to assess its potential impact on their candidate's chances. Bajoria's candidacy, driven by frustration over internal ticket allocations, has ignited speculation about how the alliance leadership will address the situation. A similar wave of independent filings is visible in Arni, where the seat has gone to BJP, leading to discontent among ally Shiv Sena (Shinde). Now Vishnu Ukende, deputy district chief of the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) will enter the fray as an independent candidate thus raising concerns about a potential split in Mahayuti's vote base. With Tuesday being the last day for filing nominations, more rebel candidates as well as friendly fights are likely to emerge across Vidarbha.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:39 IST","['city', 'nagpur']",114704639

PPP Hospital Model Faces A Health Check,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/madhya-pradeshs-controversial-ppp-hospital-model-under-scrutiny-benefits-or-risks/articleshow/114704836.cms,"  Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh govt plans to offload management of a district hospital on PPP model, asserting that this will enhance healthcare and medical education in remote districts.Critics in the public health sector ask for evidence, pointing out that pilot projects in the past failed to meet expectations.In response to TOI report on Monday, Madhya Pradesh deputy chief minister and health minister Rajendra Shukla said that the initiative aims to make MP a leader in health parameters by ensuring accessible and timely healthcare for all citizens. To achieve this, the state is adopting the PPP model to strengthen and expand healthcare services, he explained.Shukla said that NITI Aayog and the union govt support this approach, which includes establishing new medical colleges in 12 districts — Katni, Morena, Panna, Bhind, Ashoknagar, Guna, Dhar, Sidhi, Betul, Khargone, Tikamgarh, and Balaghat. This initiative seeks to uplift health standards and transform Madhya Pradesh into a medical hub through optimal resource utilization.The govt has set specific contractual terms to ensure that the benefits reach public effectively. This strategy is part of a broader vision to enhance quality and accessibility of healthcare services across the state, he said. By focusing on expanding and improving healthcare infrastructure, MP aims to deliver better health outcomes for its residents.Countering this, nine organizations representing various wings of the govt health sector and non-profit organisations expressed their opposition at a press conference on Sunday.They argued that the draft document heavily favours the private hospital operator. For instance, it does not mention ""free medical care"" explicitly, they claimed.However, it does specify that charges for medical services and treatment at the hospital will be as per Ayushman rates. Concessionaires would be entitled to receive payments under the Ayushman or any substitute thereof for services rendered to free patients.However, once the upper limit of Ayushman card is exhausted, will the patient be eligible for free care? Govt-run hospitals provide free care and heavily discounted care, irrespective of Ayushman card status.""The draft document refers to medical treatment. Under Article 21 of Constitution, the govt has a duty towards safeguarding the Right to Life, and Article 47 lists improvement of public health among its primary duties,"" said Jan Swasthya Abhiyan representative, Amulya Nidhi.""There is no evidence that PPP model for hospital operation has been successful anywhere in the country. The proposal has been undertaken without evidence or pilot projects that lead to improvements in public healthcare. A hub-and-spoke model, introduced in 2014, is a notable failure,"" he added.Dr Madhav Hasani, president of MP Medical Officers Association, highlighted a persistent issue in MP health department. ""In undivided MP there were 620 MBBS seats, today there are 1,700. In the last decades there has not been a single instance when health department had 100% filled posts. The reason is it was unattractive to lure doctors,"" Dr Hasani said.Govt says the PPP-model will solve this by facilitating recruitment of specialist doctors and skilled healthcare personnel in the new medical colleges and hospitals.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:51 IST","['city', 'bhopal']",114704836

Maharashtra polls: NCP (SP) keen to break 3-decade dominance of BJP in Ghatkopar East,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ncp-sp-challenges-bjps-30-year-reign-in-ghatkopar-east/articleshow/114704605.cms," Illegal hawkers have taken over the footpaths, complain residents of Ghatkopar East MUMBAI: For more than three decades, Ghatkopar East assembly constituency has witnessed single-party dominance — BJP. The grievances here have also remained unchanged for the most part — illegal hawker menace and lagging infrastructure improvements.After weeks of speculation, BJP retained sitting MLA and realtor Parag Shah, who held the distinction of being Maharashtra's wealthiest assembly candidate in 2019, as its pick for the Ghatkopar East constituency, a stronghold the party maintained since 1990. In 2019, Shah had won the seat in his poll debut with a margin of over 53,000 votes. However, this election is expected to be a tight contest as he faces NCP (SP) candidate Rakhee Jadhav, a veteran corporator.BJP's dominance in the constituency is attributed to the large Gujarati population residing in key neighbourhoods like Ninety Feet Road, Tilak Road, Garodia Nagar, and Rajawadi. Marathi-speaking voters, numbering around 1 lakh, are dispersed across Pant Nagar, Naidu Nagar, Nityanand Nagar, and Ramabai Colony.Clarifying a ""common misconception"" regarding Ghatkopar East, Jadhav said: ""It's often thought that this is a Gujarati-dominated seat, but that's not the case. There is a sizeable Marathi-speaking voter base, alongside a significant North Indian population.""She noted that in previous elections, votes would often split across three to four parties, with BJP consistently securing support from the Gujarati community. ""However, even people from this community now feel that BJP has merely used them, with no real development in the area,"" she added. Confident of victory, Jadhav asserted, ""This time, we are going to win the seat 100%. We are committed to bringing genuine development and addressing the traffic issues in this ward.""Prakash Wani, a former Shiv Sena (UBT) leader, expressed confidence in Jadhav's chances of bagging the seat this time, citing the support of Maha Vikas Aghadi constituents, including Congress. He also noted the discontent within the local BJP ranks following the party's decision to deny former MLA and cabinet minister Prakash Mehta the ticket.BJP delayed its candidate selection until just before the nomination deadline, reportedly due to concerns over a narrow lead of 35,000 in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections for the Ghatkopar assembly segment. Finally, the party opted to stick with Shah, despite strong claims by Mehta.Acknowledging his advantage in this BJP bastion, Shah said, ""I believe I can increase my lead by 10% compared to the last elections."" He highlighted his key achievement: the successful rehabilitation of over 18,000 slumdwellers. ""This was one of my most important commitments, and I'm proud to have fulfilled it.""Shah also expressed confidence in Mehta's support for his campaign. ""I have known him for many years, and I trust he will always act in the party's best interest.""Ghatkopar residents are hopeful that their new MLA will help address their long-standing grievances.Many residents feel that while real estate development has surged, infrastructure improvements have lagged. Ajay Shah, a resident of Tilak Road, lamented, ""The area has turned into a vegetable market, with every inch occupied by illegal hawkers between Derasar Lane and Vallabh Baug Lane. None of our elected representatives have addressed this issue."" "," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 10:05 IST","['city', 'mumbai']",114704605

As a result, farmers could not complete their fieldwork. Paddy growers failed to clear land for rabi crop sowing, said an official.The average rabi sowing area of the state is 54 lakh hectares. Jowar, wheat, and chickpeas are among the major crops this season. The average sowing of jowar accounts for 17.53 lakh hectares, chickpeas 21.52 lakh hectares, and wheat 10.48 lakh hectares.""We have recorded sowing of jowar on 2.22 lakh hectares (only 12.71%), while chickpeas have been sown barely on 28,100 hectares (1.31%) and wheat on 2,887 hectares till October 25. Sowing of these crops is less than last year's corresponding figures,"" added officials. Vaibhav Tambe, head of the statistics division of state agriculture, told TOI, ""The early trend of sowing is worrisome, mainly because of the extended rain in the state. But we are hopeful of seeing a jump in sowing in the coming weeks as there is adequate moisture in the soil and no water scarcity.""Maharashtra is one of the leading states in the country in harvesting jowar, chickpeas, and wheat. ""Jowar has become a major rabi crop due to high demand for it in the market. As a result, many districts have seen increased areas under this crop. The rural economy, particularly in Marathwada and Vidarbha, is dependent on harvest of jowar. We expect to achieve the average areas of the crop this year, too,"" said a senior agriculture department official.In 2022, the agricultural yield of jowar in the state was 1,038 kg/hectare, which was higher than in 2021. Maharashtra gets high-standard jowar from Solapur and Dharashiv districts, said an official. The average sowing area of Dharashiv and Solapur districts is 1.81 lakh hectares and 3.18 lakh hectares.""However, the actual sowing in Dharashiv is on 3,054 hectares, which is barely 2%, while in Solapur we have recorded sowing on 44,204 hectares, which accounts for only 14%. We are expecting to change this trend in the coming weeks as jowar growers have initiated their fieldwork. More sowing is expected to take place,"" said a senior official from the department.When it comes to chickpeas, officials said that they noticed two-digit sowing only in Solapur (10%) in the state. Maharashtra is one of the major states contributing to the country's chickpea production. It accounts for 25.97% of the national chickpea production.""However, sowing of chickpeas is yet to gain momentum in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. Pune division, which covers Ahmednagar, Pune, and Solapur districts, has recorded highest sowing in the state on 14,874 hectares,"" added a senior department official.

The accused met the survivor four years ago and allegedly took advantage of his friendship with the 16-year-old. Their friendship gradually deepened, and the accused often took her on outings to local parks and cafes and during these outings, he would secretly take her photographs.Two years ago, the accused lured the victim to his rented room on Kolua Road, where he sexually assaulted her under the threat of revealing her photographs to her family.

He threatened to harm her family if she refused to comply. The survivor was forced to give him approximately Rs 5 lakh.Survivor's ordeal culminated in a particularly brutal incident around seven or eight months ago when the accused summoned her to his home at night and assaulted her, even going so far as to injure her left hand with a blade. He reiterated his threats against her family, instilling fear and terror in the young girl. The victim's family finally became aware of the situation a week ago when she gave Rs 1,000 to Nikki.

While Tuesday is the last day for filing the nomination, candidates can withdraw their nominations till Nov 4.There was speculation that Sarvankar was under pressure to withdraw his nomination from Mahim constituency where Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray's son Amit is making his poll debut. In fact, Shiv Sena minister Deepak Kesarkar had said that as Thackeray had extended unconditional support to the Mahayuti during the Lok Sabha election without taking any seats, it was their ""duty"" to support his son Amit's candidature. Kesarkar even held talks with Sarvankar and Thackeray on Saturday. Clearing the air on Monday, Sarvankar said: ""There may be speculation in rival camps, but there is no speculation or discussion in the Shiv Sena. People have voted for me for the last 30 years...I met CM Eknath Shinde on Sunday night, and he gave me the AB form, blessings, and all campaign material. I have not got any call from Raj Thackeray. Whatever Deepak Kesarkar or BJP's Ashish Shelar have said is their personal views."" Sarvankar's son, former corporator Samadhan, also posted on social media that his father will file the nomination on Tuesday. Speculation was also rife that if the MNS doesn't field a candidate from Kopri-Pachpakhadi where Shinde is contesting, then the Sena may not field a candidate in Sewri, where MNS has declared Bala Nandgaonkar as its candidate. So far, the Sena hasn't named anyone from Sewri."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 14:56 IST","['city', 'mumbai']",114704652

Maha Kumbh to be grandest ever: CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/maha-kumbh-2025-a-grand-invitation-from-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/114704653.cms," 12 Lucknow: Saying that Maha Kumbh-2025 will be the grandest ever, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday extended invite to saints and devotees across the country to attend the mega religious event in Prayagraj. ""This grandest celebration of Sanatan Dharma will surpass all previous Kumbhs in size and grandeur,"" said Yogi, who was at the Dera Siddh Baba Garibnath Math in Pehowa, Haryana.Yogi also congratulated Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini on his recent electoral victory and expressed gratitude to the people of the state for electing a BJP govt. Saini was also present at the programme.He praised their support, stating that they embodied Lord Krishna's words, ""Paritranaay Sadhunaam, Vinaashay Cha Dushkritam.""With Haryana being the land of Lord Krishna's ‘Karmayog', Yogi added, those who acted wrongly would face unfavourable outcomes.The CM explained that religion has two core objectives: Abhudaya and Nishreyas. Abhudaya represents worldly progress, where one channels energy toward public welfare in alignment with individual capabilities, requiring wise decision-making. ""For progress, we need good saints in the religious field and the right people in development efforts. Positive results stem from choosing virtuous individuals. A yogi or committed householder cannot achieve spiritual fulfilment, or Nishreyas, by ignoring worldly duties, or Abhudaya. This commitment not only establishes a foundation for achieving public welfare and development but also leads to the path of salvation,"" he said.The CM said true spirituality did not mean abandoning society, referring to Adi Shankaracharya, a saint from Kerala, who established four spiritual centres in the four corners of India through public awareness and ‘shashtrartha'.Remembering a bhajan by Guru Shri Triloknath Babu of the Guru Gorakhnath Ashram in Junagadh, he said, ""Sant hain suhaagi, rehte sada magan, jaate hai jis lok mein sada karte chaman (Saints are ever-blessed, always in joy, bringing beauty to every realm they enter).""Talking about Pehowa's spiritual legacy, the CM told the audience that the teachings of Yogi Satyanath from there spread across the country. However, in recent times, the area's condition declined, and Mahant Shernath deserved praise for renewing the faith of devotees by revitalising not only Pehowa but also long-neglected holy sites in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli. ""This sacred land, which declined for four generations, is now on a path to revitalisation under the guidance of a yogi. Pehowa is the holy ground of the renowned Siddha Yogi Garibnath ji of the Nath sect,"" the CM said, adding that the event he was attending was taking place on the banks of the Saraswati River, which the Haryana govt was fully committed to reviving.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:40 IST","['city', 'lucknow']",114704653

Among them is BJP leader Nilesh Rane, son of Narayan Rane, who is contesting from a Shiv Sena seat by joining the party.Similarly, BJP's Santosh Shetty is now the candidate from the Bhiwandi East seat for Shiv Sena. Shetty is known for his social work in Bhiwandi and has a good influence not only among Hindus but also within the Muslim community. Now, he will face the Samajwadi Party's Rais Sheikh on the Bhiwandi East seat, who has created a distinct identity in Bhiwandi with his work. In such a situation, it will be worth watching who wins the election in this minority-dominated seat. — Pradeep Gupta","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:51 IST","['city', 'mumbai']",114704844

An official said that the directive was issued following reports of significant seizure of cash, gold, drugs, and gifts from these constituencies during Lok Sabha polls this year.""We are keeping a strict vigil on all constituencies. We have issued instructions to all district election officers and returning officers and hoping for co-operation from all candidates and political parties,"" said state additional CEO Dr Kiran Kulkarni.Officials noted that several candidates also exceeded prescribed spending limits in these segments, so these constituencies were marked.

He also said that no one could label TVK as the ‘B' team of any other party, as they are clearly declaring their stance and fundamental principle as ‘Pirapokkum Ella Uyirkum' (all are equal by birth).Responding to questions on Vijay's comments regarding power sharing, S Regupathy said, ""They (TVK) have to meet people in all the 234 assembly constituencies in Tamil Nadu, nominate candidates, and secure votes from the voters to form a majority govt.

"Ratanji was simple, honest, unpretentious. Above all, he valued human relationships",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/remembering-ratanji-a-legacy-of-humility-integrity-and-human-connection/articleshow/114704651.cms," 12 Despite leading an industrial empire, he embodied the Indian principle of ‘Upbhogshunya Swami' (non-consumer owner), with a sense of ownership devoid of indulgence, writes Union minister Nitin GadkariI recall an incident from my tenure as the minister of Public Works Department in Maharashtra. Over my eighteen years of stint in Mumbai, I met Mr Ratan Tata many a time. He would visit my home, and I, in turn, would go to his. One day, while coming to my house in Malabar Hill, he called me, saying, ""Nitin, I've forgotten the way to your house..."" I suggested him to pass the phone to his driver so that I could explain the directions. But his response surprised me. Ratanji, a billionaire, was driving himself...no driver, no security! This was his natural, humble way, as I came to know well over the years. Ratanji was a remarkable person; simple, honest, and unpretentious. He was older than me, yet we became close friends, sharing a bond that spanned three decades. He would visit me in Mumbai, come to Delhi, and even to Nagpur. I remember an incident. Dr Hedgewar Hospital in Sambhaji Nagar was ready and its inauguration was being planned. Senior RSS Pracharak Shri Mukundrao Panshikar told me that the hospital should be inaugurated only by Ratanji and the responsibility to bring him to Sambhaji Nagar is yours! I went to his office with the hospital director. When I invited Ratanji, he laughed and quipped, ""Nitin, I've never even inaugurated my own factory."" I told him that, if we are friends, you have to accept the invitation. He agreed without further persuasion and flew by his private special flight to Sambhaji Nagar. I was with him. During the visit, he asked if the hospital will serve only Hindus, given its RSS affiliation. I assured him it was open to all and RSS does not discriminate. He was pleased, saying true service lies in helping everyone who is in need. This was the essence of Ratanji, a person who lived humbly, who always carried his own bag, and who preferred to sit on the seat of the host which is next to the driver. He openly supported my projects like the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, the Sea Link, and flyovers, and often praised me both in public and private. He and the then Governor Dr PC Alexander wrote me the letters of appreciation that I still cherish. During that time, we raised funds for infrastructure projects of MSRDC through bonds. Initially, in 1996, we aimed to raise Rs500 crores. We received Rs1,150 crores. Then, again we floated bonds for Rs600 crores, we got Rs1,200 crores. Our bonds were oversubscribed. Then, once when we met, he humorously remarked, ""You're more professional than me. I never expected this much response for infra projects."" He genuinely celebrated my success and complimented me for the same with the best wishes. It's easy to call someone humble and down to earth. But with Ratanji, I saw what it truly meant. For instance, he once piloted a helicopter to inaugurate a flyover in Washi. Flying was casual for him, without any hint of pride. His home in Colaba had only a few attendants and dogs; nothing extravagant. Despite leading an industrial empire, he embodied the Indian principle of ‘Upbhogshunya Swami' (non-consumer owner), with a sense of ownership devoid of indulgence.While many build industries for profit, the Tata family had long committed to returning wealth to society, a legacy that Ratanji continued. Under his leadership, Tata companies strengthened the economy and provided employment to lakhs of people. He was, in a way, a guiding light, a lighthouse, ensuring his vast business ventures also served society. His charity work was prolific, not bound by the limits of professional ethics but reaching deeply into social responsibility, which meant so much to me. Above all, he valued human relationships. Known for his empathy and respect, he remembered people's names, treated employees with affection, and approached colleagues as equals, not subordinates. He embodied the highest ideals of integrity. It is said that if a person is blessed with power, wealth, beauty and knowledge, he becomes egoistic and arrogant. Ratanji was an exception. Despite his achievements and influence, he was free from pride. He was warm not only with business associates but also with employees, calling them by their first names and treating them as colleagues. His office was not a hierarchy but a community of respect and kindness. During my tenure as an MLC, I remember advocating for the Empress Mills in Nagpur, urging Tata management to run it to support the livelihood of 5,000 workers employed there. I had brought him to Nagpur. Tata management wanted about 1,500 workers to be retrenched. The trade union took the different stance. The mill had to be closed. It was taken over by the government. The dues of employees were pending. I went to Tata Sons and told them that, all workers are poor. They have spent a lifetime working in your unit. Government will not pay their dues. You should pay the same and extend helping hand. At my request, Tata Sons provided funds to settle worker dues without any consideration of legal obligation. This deeply increased my respect for them. I feel that, of all the Tata Group's ventures, Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital in Mumbai is a great institution. It has been providing services to the poor for decades. The Tata Group's commitment to social service continues through Tata Trusts, an unusual and noble structure that ensures profits for the benefit of society. Ratanji was a role model in the truest sense — a unique blend of achievement and humility that continues to inspire. For all who knew him, he carried the warmth of humanity. His memory is precious to me, a guiding example that will always remain in my heart. Ratanji is unforgettable. I pay my deepest respects to his memory.

His two sons, Parth and Jay, and some beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme accompanied Ajit Pawar on the penultimate day of filing of nominations.In contrast, Yugendra, NCP (SP) candidate from the seat, followed his granduncle Sharad Pawar's footsteps and visited the ancestral home in Baramati's Amrai, the same house from where Pawar senior had gone to the tehsil office in 1967 to file his first ever nomination to contest assembly polls. ""I visited the tehsil office 57 years ago to file my nomination, and the people of Baramati have supported me since that day. My advice to the new generation looking to get into politics is to be polite and stay connected with the common people. That connection will make them successful in this field,"" said Sharad Pawar.Ajit Pawar and Yugendra filed their papers within half an hour of each other for the second round after the LS polls of the Pawar vs Pawar battle in Baramati. Yugendra's parents, Shrinivas and Sharmila Pawar, and aunt Supriya Sule, Baramati MP, also accompanied him. ""I feel quite fortunate that Pawar saheb was by my side when I filed the nomination. For me, it is not important who is against me. I give more importance to who is supporting me. My focus will be on addressing issues such as unemployment, rise in crime and the agrarian crisis,"" he told TOI.Ajit Pawar said after filing his papers, ""I won't be able to spend much time here considering my visits to other constituencies, but I am confident the people of Baramati will ensure my win.""Ajit Pawar said the rival faction had made a mistake by nominating his nephew against him. ""I admitted [after the LS polls] that it was my mistake to field a candidate against a family member (Sule). Now, they have fielded a family member against me and committed the same mistake. They should have avoided the mistake."" Ruing that ""the level of politics has gone down"", he said, ""Bonding in a family is built over generations. But it takes hardly any time to break a family. Differences in the family should remain within the four walls. Once there is a split, it is difficult to bridge the gap.""He said his mother, Ashatai Pawar, had advised NCP (SP) not to field a candidate against him. ""Despite [that], who took the call to field the candidate against me? It's said to be Pawar saheb's call. Does that mean Pawar saheb has created a split in our family?"" His younger brother Shrinivas Pawar rebuffed his claim. ""As per my knowledge, my mother never made such a statement,"" he said."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 10:12 IST","['city', 'mumbai']",114704810

She alleged that BJP-led Centre had constantly subverted the values of the Constitution and policy after policy was made to favour the Prime Minister's friends.Priyanka added that the state govt was not discharging its duties, citing the issue of Wayanad medical college and the delay in paying compensation to victims of landslide disaster. State govt has to pay a part of the total compensation. Priyanka, who refrained from political attacks at her nomination rally last week, bared her combative side by saying that fear, mistrust and anger were being spread among different communities by BJP.""You saw what happened in Manipur. You have seen again and again the spread of hatred by this govt in a concerted, planned fashion. Today we have a BJP govt at the Centre that does not respect the Constitution. What are its political policies and strategies- it is to divide the people so that they can come to power,"" she said. Priyanka asked what was the point in PM Narendra Modi coming to Wayanad and meeting victims if he cannot release funds. She said the same had happened in Himachal Pradesh. ""Look at their pattern… Before there were floods in Wayanad, a similar incident happened in Himachal. Modi did not declare it a national disaster or send funds for political reasons. The same thing happened here,"" she said.Priyanka said BJP-led govt had no compassion for farmers or respect for tribal people. She alleged that lands belonging to tribal people were being handed over to businessmen who are friends of the PM.She said she would take up issues like unavailability of a full-fledged medical college, man-animal conflict if elected. When asked if the anti-incumbency sentiment against the state govt will get reflected in bypolls, she said govt had failed to discharge certain responsibilities. ""We have the medical college issue, providing compensation to victims here. There are many issues that must be resolved. People are fed up by many things, so I think it will possibly reflect,"" she said.Responding to LDF and NDA's allegations that voters will not get to see her if she's elected, Priyanka took a dig by asking if these fronts are standing together. She said critics could see how much time she spends in the constituency if she won.She recounted the story that when she went to leave her son at the school hostel, the principal told her that she should come once in four months and after four months the principal said she need not come to the school too often. ""Just like the principal, you are going to get so fed up that you are going to say please don't come often,"" she added."," Oct 29, 2024, 00:39 IST","['city', 'kozhikode']",114704641

Significantly, the party has fielded 150 candidates across Maharashtra to promote regional autonomy.After filing nomination papers, the party's candidate for Nagpur East Taresh Gajanan Durugkar told TOI that if elected, the party would vigorously push statehood for Vidarbha and Khandesh. Desh Janhit Party candidates in Nagpur include Dharamendra Mandlik (Nagpur Central), Sudhir Patil (Nagpur North), Nilesh Dhoke (Nagpur West), Kunal Kalbende (Nagpur South), and Ghanshyam Purohit (Nagpur South-West).Another party batting for Vidarbha statehood, the Jai Vidarbha Party (JVP), had planned to contest all 62 Vidarbha seats. JVP has since partnered with Parivartan Maha Shakti and will now compete from 10 key constituencies. JVP national vice-president Mukesh Masurkar said nominations have been filed for Kamptee, Hingna, Nagpur North, Nagpur Central, Morshi, and Yavatmal, with additional candidates in other Vidarbha districts.JVP leaders cited NDA's push for smaller states during then PM Atal Behari Vajpayee's tenure that led to the creation of states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Uttarakhand.Before 2014 general elections, top BJP leaders like Nitin Gadkari and Devendra Fadnavis pledged support for Vidarbha's statehood, with Fadnavis even raising the issue in the legislative assembly. Despite these assurances, the goal remains unfulfilled following both the 2014 and 2019 elections.The Vidarbha Rajya Aghadi (Viraa), another pro-statehood group, fielded eight candidates in the 2019 state elections under Vidarbha Nirmal Mahamanch banner. However, Viraa's candidates struggled to secure votes, reflecting the challenges faced by regional statehood movements in garnering mainstream support.","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:40 IST","['city', 'nagpur']",114704676

No retaliatory challans in city on Raj roadways: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/traffic-police-deny-targeted-challans-amid-ongoing-bus-fare-dispute/articleshow/114704689.cms,"  Gurgaon: The Gurgaon traffic police have denied taking any retaliatory action against the Rajasthan Roadways buses. This comes in the wake of a recent video that went viral on social media in which a woman cop from Haryana refused to pay the fare in a Rajasthan Roadways bus. An ugly argument between the cop and the conductor of the bus ensued. Later, it was reported that Haryana police and Rajasthan police, in retaliation against each other, were issuing challans to roadways buses. However, DCP (traffic) Virender Vij issued a statement on Monday to clarify that ""no retaliatory or targeted challans"" were being issued by the police. ""We are issuing challans without any attempt to target anyone,"" he said.Vij said such reports after the viral video were ""incorrect"". According to the traffic police, they are conducting a drive against lane driving in Oct. So far, 3,600 challans for lane driving have been issued, out of which only 400 challans were issued to buses. Vij said challans have been issued to all kinds of vehicles, including state road transport buses. ""Out of these 400 challans to buses, only 11 were issued to Rajasthan Roadways buses, while 150 were issued to Haryana Roadways buses, 41 to Delhi transport buses and 55 to school buses. Besides, more than 100 challans were issued to buses from other states. It is totally wrong to say that only Rajasthan Roadways buses are being challaned,"" the DCP said.Amid a series of challans — Haryana Police penalising RSRTC buses plying into the bordering state and Rajasthan Traffic Police retaliating a day later — senior RSRTC officials said they would examine the matter and discuss it with Haryana Police. Speaking to TOI, RSRTC managing director Purushottam Sharma said, ""I have come across this information. I will examine the whole matter and seek a report. Thereafter, we will have a word with the authorities to resolve the issue. At the same time, the drivers have been instructed to follow every traffic rule to avoid challans.""Though RSRTC did not offer further comment, officials said Rajasthan buses were ""targeted"" not only in Haryana but also in Delhi. Similar action followed in Rajasthan, with the state traffic police hauling up Haryana Roadways buses in Jaipur on Sunday. RSRTC officials said over 80 challans were issued to Haryana Roadways buses and their drivers. Yogesh Dadhich, ACP (Traffic), Jaipur, said multiple challans were issued for buses from Haryana, UP, and others for operating without proper permits, and not wearing uniforms, among other offences. RSRTC, meanwhile, said, ""It is unfortunate such a thing happened, but we are in talks with the Haryana administration to find a solution and resolve the matter. Prima facie, it seems that the RSRTC conductor was not at fault, but still, this situation has come up now. On Sunday, around 70-80 challans were issued, but we are working to resolve it.""(With inputs from Ashish Mehta & Suparna Roy in Jaipur)","  Oct 29, 2024, 00:41 IST","['city', 'gurgaon']",114704689

Delhi culture is all about celebrating in a grand way and we love that. As a rule now, after 10.30-11pm I just have fun at my parties. I am a perfect host till 7.30-10.30pm, but after that I start dancing and I love it. When you are relaxed and having fun then even guests have fun. My friends tell me that they love coming to my home as they meet some very interesting people. I am happy that I am able to connect so many people,” she says.'I always include real, seasonal flowers in the decor and marigold has to be there as for me it represents tradition and adds an Indian touch,' says Shalini'You will see all my favourites on the thaali, imarti has to be there as it is my favourite,' says Shalini‘At my parties, I serve people what I like and don’t assume what they would like’Shalini says, “On Diwali we serve traditional food and it is mostly home cooked. I always serve guests what I like, I never assume what they will like. It’s best to include things you like in the menu as you know about them. People are very conscious about eating heavy food but they still want delicious food. We always have a lot of healthy dishes on the menu, and in desserts we have fruits and sugar free options. You will see all my favourites on the thaali, imarti has to be there as it is my favourite. Other dishes are dal makhni, bhindi fry, shahi paneer, khatta baigan, which is a Hyderabadi recipe. We make sure that food is not too spicy or heavy and yet it is delicious. I usually send a save the date notification to my guests very much in advance as everyone has multiple engagements, especially around Diwali. The caterer has to be booked if I am not going for home cooked food. We mostly do thaali dinner on Diwali as we all love to celebrate the festival traditionally.”She adds that she makes sure to serve dinner by 9pm at her parties. “I used to go to so many parties and no one would serve food before 11pm. Who eats at 11pm! No one wants to eat this late. I always serve dinner by 9pm and guests expect that from me now. People don’t serve dinner on time because they think that the party will break and guests will start leaving. But I think if you have called someone to your house, you have to serve them dinner, if they want to stay or not is up to them. They can party after having dinner also. I am also very particular about timing so now all my friends know that they have to come on time and I may not invite them next time if they don’t come on time. My parties start around 7.30-8pm,” she adds.She added, “The dinner table mats feature silver with gold plating. The gold embroidery on the table napkins, the engraved pattern on silver thaalis are my designs. I got them customised. All cutlery is from Christofle. I always include real, seasonal flowers in the decor and marigold has to be there as for me it represents tradition and adds an Indian touch. I like bright colours. We use a lot of yellow flowers and mix it with purple and violet.”Ramona Narang, Shalini Passi, Roberto Cavalli and Queenie at a party held at Shalini’s house‘One of the best Diwali party was when we hosted Roberto Cavalli’Diwali parties have been a tradition at Shalini’s place since they moved into this house in 2011.

Says restaurateur Vikrant Batra, who owns chains of restaurants like Café Delhi Heights in NCR, “Planning a Halloween menu is an art of storytelling. We start by choosing a theme that sets the tone for the entire experience. Our chefs and mixologists then weave a culinary narrative, transforming our signature dishes and drinks into characters from the theme. Every detail, from names to presentation, is carefully crafted to create an immersive experience. Inspiration comes from horror movies, folklore, and the darker side of imagination. We aim to create an atmosphere that's both eerie and inviting, making our guests feel like they're part of a haunted tale.”“We were trying to do something related to old school cartoons related to witches cauldrons and potions with a fun take on our theme. It took us about two weeks to conceptualise and create our drinks. It consisted of a lot of trial and error until we finally perfected them. The inspiration comes from trying to or wanting to relive our childhood again. This year our theme is ‘Worst Date Horror’,” adds Aayush Thapliyal, Mixologist at Monkey Bar. Since October 31 is also Diwali, some outlets have designed their menus keeping Halloween and Diwali in mind.

While some may be hesitant to try dishes that appear gory, others are eager for the novelty and Instagram-worthy moments.”Says Sahil, “Halloween now is pretty looked up to.

It’s time of add some gold and glitter to your wardrobe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/fashion/style-guide/its-time-of-add-some-gold-and-glitter-to-your-wardrobe/articleshow/114695523.cms," Fashion experts say that add a shimmering gold outfit to your wardrobe A little black dress, classic blazer and pant suit and sari were always recommended as a must-have for any woman's wardrobe. Now fashion experts say that add a shimmering gold outfit to that list too – it can be a sari, gown, drape dress or a jumpsuit and the shade of gold can vary as per your choice and style. Be it the international runways, red carpet events or designer shows here, it is tough to miss the all-gold look.‘The colour gold has become more wearable now,’ say designersDesigners share that over the last few years, one change that has come in is that there is gold for everyone, in different shades and in varying designs. Says designer Namrata Joshipura, who has extensively worked with gold as a shade in her outfits, “I have always loved gold and I think most Indian women have a liking for it because it suits the Indian skin tone so well. While earlier, they would only choose jewellery in gold, now opting for gold outfit is not something out of the box. One reason for that is that it has been a fashion trend and is all over social media, in high street fashion stores. Today customers are more informed and aware of global fashion trends and as gold look became popular worldwide more people are now willing to embrace the look. My customers are from all age groups, and everyone wants gold.Rina Dhaka adds that over the years “the colour gold has become more wearable now.” She says, “There is gold for every wardrobe- one can find a gold sari, in brocade or sequined or zardozi, gold pant suit in brocade or with embroidery or corset top with skirt or gowns or jumpsuits. With the increasing acceptance for gold outfits, every designer and brand is using gold. Also, the popularity of chunky gold jewellery, accessories and celebs dressed in all gold look is inspiring many to dress up in gold.”Choose the shade of gold as per your tasteWhen one thinks of gold, one mostly thinks of bling and shimmer, but for those who want something understated, there are different tones of gold available. “I have done some beautiful lehengas and gowns with gold as a primary shade and undertones of other pastel shades,” says designer Mandira Wirk. Adds Namrata Joshipura, “I think one has to find a way to balance your gold outfit with right accessories, as per different occasions. One can choose pearls with a gold outfit, if they do not want everything gold.”‘Men are yet to embrace gold outfits’Some celebrities might have worn gold suit on the red carpet and turned heads, but not many men are still willing to don gold. “At weddings some men may wear a gold sherwani or a kurta, but not many men are open to wearing something like a gold suit. They may also include gold as a shade as part of layering, but all good look is still not popular among men. It is still restricted to some celebrities and the red carpet,” says designer Pawan Sachdeva.Pro tips to pull off the gilded look:*Choose your shade and fabric of gold as per your style and occasion, for example one can go for sequined fabric, brocade, organza, satin or tissue*Go with minimal jewellery, like one statement piece of earrings, necklace, do not add too many accessories*Choose classy gold clutch and pair of footwear to complete the look*When you choose your accessories, make sure that they are not different tones of gold that do not blend when worn together- Inputs from celebrity stylist Isha Bhansali","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:00 IST","['life-style', 'fashion', 'style-guide']",114695523

Essential tips for eye care for safe Diwali celebrations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/essential-tips-for-eye-care-for-safe-diwali-celebrations/articleshow/114656705.cms,"  With India's biggest festival already here, we must take all the precautions to safeguard our eyes. Many unfortunate people lose their eyesight every year due to firecrackers, smoke and the following pollution. Many others report eye problems such as irritation, redness, and watery eyes. Therefore, it is crucial to follow the advice of ophthalmologists and these eye care tips during Diwali. Common Eye Problems During Diwali1. Firecracker InjuriesEven though there is a ban on bursting crackers in many states, firecrackers still make their way to our homes during Diwali. We all love bursting crackers, but they pose a serious threat to the eyes. Almost every cracker emits hot sparks and debris from them can lead to severe eye injuries. Some of the common eye injuries due to crackers are trauma to the eyeballs, abrasions to the cornea, burns in and around the eyes, etc..2. Dry Eyes and IrritationDuring this time, the air is filled with the smoke from firecrackers. This makes the air more polluted, causing discomfort and dry eyes, leading to pain, redness, and a feeling of burning in the eyes. People with sensitive eyes or pre-existing disorders like dry eye syndrome find it difficult to see properly during the time of Diwali.3. Allergic ConjunctivitisThis is one of the most common problems during Diwali, caused by dust and air pollution. In this problem, eyes get red, itchy and there is swelling of the eyelids, making it difficult to see. 4. Eye Problems due to smokeThe dense smoke emitting fireworks can irritate the eyes, causing watering, redness, and itching. If a person is exposed t such smoke, he can permanently damage his eyes. It also worsens pre-existing diseases like asthma or dry eyes.5. Sensitivity to Diwali lightsDuring Diwali, fireworks and bright lights cause light sensitivity or photophobia. Older people and children find adjusting to high-intensity lighting and fireworks glare challenging, leading to headaches or eye strain. Tips to Protect Eyes During Diwali1. Wear Protective EyewearThis Diwali, protect your eyes by wearing glasses or goggles. They effectively protect the eyes from firecracker sparks, dust and, pollution etc.. 2. Keeping a safe distance from the crackers During bursting crackers, it is important to maintain a safe distance from them. Also, ensure that firecrackers are lit in open, spacious areas to minimise the effects of smoke. Those bursting crackers should maintain a distance of at least 5–6 meters from the firework launch point.4. Use Eye DropsThose with pre-existing eye problems shud use lubricating eye drops recommended by the doctor.5. Avoid Smoke and PollutantsThose with a history of eye problems during Diwali should try to stay indoors. Such eye patients should use air purifiers in their homes and avoid areas with a lot of smoke or fireworks activity outdoors.6. Stay HydratedMany would not know, but drinking water keeps the eyes hydrated, protecting them from dryness. Drinking water is recommended for general health anyway, as it removes toxins from the body.(Dr. Jay Goyal, Eye Surgeon, LASIK, Retina Specialist, and Director at Surya Eye Hospital, Mumbai)","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:03 IST","['life-style', 'health-fitness', 'health-news']",114656705

Secret to long-lasting love: 5 reasons humour can deepen emotional bond,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/love-sex/secret-to-long-lasting-love-5-reasons-humour-can-deepen-emotional-bond/articleshow/114702460.cms,"  A person always dreams of their perfect partner. Everyone has their unique style in picking their partners. They want their partner to be funny, charming, intelligent, handsome, beautiful, cheerful, loving, caring, and much more. But the most important thing about being with your partner is how they treat you and make you comfortable and safe. Many people use their sense of humor as a tool to make their relationship happy and going. If you have a partner who is funny and can make you laugh easily, there is a huge possibility that you will always be happy with them. Laughter is often called the best medicine. When you are in a relationship, humor can play a significant role in strengthening your relationship. Laughing together at each other’s jokes can create an emotional bond and connection that provides the safety, security, and comfort a partner looks for. A sense of humor can boost satisfaction in a relationship. Here are some reasons how humor can strengthen your relationship: Stress-free environmentBeing in a relationship can be very stressful and challenging at times. Your day-to-day life responsibilities and duties may interfere with your relationship, which can create stress and tension. Imagine coming back from work in a bad mood and your partner spoiling your mood by picking a fight. However, if you or your partner has a sense of humor, it can ease the tension and make you stress-free. If your partner cracks a light, well-timed joke, it can lighten the situation, dissolve the tension, and calm you down. Builds intimacyBeing in a relationship can foster intimacy; it can build an emotional connection where you laugh together and share a positive experience; you relate to it, and it can easily make you feel comfortable and connected. Humor allows you to ease stress and tension and build trust. Reduces conflictsEvery couple fights; the easiest way to navigate a fight is by using your sense of humor. When you use your sense of humor, it can resolve conflicts; it makes the situation light, and you can see the situation and the argument from a different perspective. Humor can help ease the tension and situation and lighten each other’s mood. Builds memoriesMany people love telling stories and store a bunch of their stories to tell their friends, partners, or children in the future. Humor is one of the best tools to build memories with your partner. Imagine being in a difficult situation and you or your partner cracks a well-timed joke at the moment; you will remember that joke and that moment. Humor helps build memories. The fun side of each otherWhen you get comfortable with your partner after a while, you get to know them better. If you use humor in your relationship, it can help bring out the fun side of your partner; you won't have to wait for weeks for them to open up. Humor can be on the playful side of each other.Sushmita Sen opens up about heartbreaks to daughters Renee and Alisah","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:00 IST","['life-style', 'relationships', 'love-sex']",114702460
Troop disengagement nearly complete at 2 Ladakh sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/troop-disengagement-nearly-complete-at-2-ladakh-sites/articleshow/114704982.cms,"  NEW DELHI: India and China have “more or less” completed their phased disengagement from the two remaining face-off sites at Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh, with rival troops falling back almost to their pre-April 2020 positions after dismantling their temporary posts, sheds, tents and other structures erected in the two areas.“The plan now is to fully verify the mutual pullback over the next two days, both physically on the ground as well as through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Some verification has already begun. Coordinated patrolling by the two sides will thereafter take place,” a top defence establishment source told TOI on Monday night.The Indian Army plans to launch its patrols in Depsang and Demchok by the end of this month, with advance notice being given to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to prevent the possibility of any face-off or clash.The strength of the patrols will depend on the task assigned to them as well as the distance to be covered. “The shorter-range patrols have 10-15 soldiers, while the longer ones 20-25. Our troops should now get full and unrestricted access to our traditional patrolling points (PPs), where our soldiers were being blocked from going to earlier,” a source said.The PLA will also intimate India before sending out its patrols, under the “patrolling arrangements” for Depsang-Demchok first announced by India on Oct 21 after a flurry of diplomatic and military talks, which paved the way for the Modi-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Russia two days later.Sources, meanwhile, also said talks are underway to ease the situation in “sensitive” areas like Yangtse, Asaphila and Subansiri river valley in Arunachal Pradesh.All this, however, does not mean that the festering border confrontation with China, which erupted after the PLA’s multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in a well-coordinated manner in April-May 2020, is anywhere close to being resolved.For that to happen, China will have to agree to de-escalation along the entire 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, with both sides also de-inducting their well over 1,00,000 troops each that have been forward deployed along the entire frontier.The “full verification” of the Depsang-Demchok disengagement will take two days since Indian “tactical commanders” will physically go to some PPs to check if all “PLA obstructions” have been removed. “In some places, it takes six to eight hours to reach our PPs,” the source said.In the strategically located Depsang Plains, which is towards the crucial Daulat Beg Oldie and Karakoram Pass in the north, Chinese troops have pulled back from their positions on the “east side” of the “Bottleneck” area, while Indian soldiers have moved back from the “west” one. PLA till now was actively blocking Indian soldiers at the Bottleneck area, which is around 18km inside what India considers its own territory.Similarly, Indian soldiers will now get access to two PPs in the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok in the south, while Indian shepherds will also be able to take their animals to traditional grazing grounds there.The Depsang-Demchok pact does not include the creation of no-patrol buffer zones that came up after the earlier disengagements till Sept 2022. The rival military officers are separately discussing restoration of patrolling rights at the buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3-km to 10-km, which largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:11 IST",['india'],114704982
"Anti-incumbency, non-performance, sympathy: Battle lines are drawn for another NCP vs NCP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ncp-showdown-battle-for-hadapsar-constituency-heats-up-ahead-of-elections/articleshow/114704969.cms,"  Pune: Despite being one of the highest tax-paying wards in the city, residents of several areas under Hadapsar constituency have been grappling with traffic congestion and poor road conditions for years, which is likely to make the upcoming fight tough for the current MLA (NCP), Chetan Tupe. Katraj resident Tukaram Sandbhor said nothing has changed for the better in the last five years. ""The problems we raised in the 2019 assembly election remain. The roads are so bad that driving around is risky. Several accidents have occurred on Katraj-Kondhwa road, but authorities have paid no attention.""With the rise in population, the needs of the constituency have increased, Alan D'Costa from Fatima Nagar said. ""However, whoever takes charge after every election tends to focus only on certain areas, or the ones they are living in. There should be 360-degree development. Traffic, water, and roads are some of the issues that the new legislator must focus on."" Tupe, who has faced criticism for non-performance, said he is against new constructions because there is absolutely no scope to accommodate more people as the current infrastructure is not enough. ""We have constructed new roads in the last five years, making movement much faster than before. The metro will resolve the traffic problems,"" he said, in an apparent reference to the state approval for an extension of the metro line to Hadapsar from Swargate. A constituency that has chosen three different parties — Shiv Sena, BJP, and NCP — in three assembly polls since its formation in 2009 is not new to an anti-incumbency wave. Another factor that might prove worrisome for Tupe is voters' sympathy for Sharad Pawar's faction as after winning the 2019 poll on an NCP ticket, the legislator sided with Ajit Pawar's party following a split. Renominated by Mahayuti this time, he is taking on Prashant Jagtap from NCP (SCP), who served as mayor from 2015 to 2016 and is believed to be well-acquainted with the city's pressing issues.

""Since VBA had already decided on its candidate for Shevgaon, I opted to fight as an independent.""About the controversy surrounding his daughter, he said the action was politically motivated as some people did not like him contesting the LS election. ""My daughter was shown in a bad light and her media trial began soon after the parliamentary election was over. It resulted in my daughter and I facing a plethora of problems. However, I would not succumb to pressure even now. I am contesting the election as it is my right.""

The spot where these rifles were found is 15-km away from the ordnance factory. ""Some residents from the area found the rifles and alerted us,"" Janardhan Khanderao, assistant inspector of the Varangaon police station in rural Jalgaon, told TOI. ""Our team reached the spot and took the rifles in possession. The OFV authorities later confirmed that these rifles were part of the three AK-47s and two Galil rifles stolen between Oct 19 and 21 from the factory,"" Khanderao said.OFV general manager Mahesh Shinde, while talking to TOI, said, ""The police have informed us about the recovery of three rifles. Prima facie, these are our weapons considering that Galil rifle is available only with us. We are yet to get specifications of the recovered weapons."" Khanderao said the police were continuing with their investigation to identify the suspects behind the theft and recover the remaining two stolen rifles. ""We are currently analyzing the footage of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to gather clues,"" he said.The theft at the OVF raised a major security concern as the facility manufactures military-grade small arms and ammunition for armed forces and security agencies. It has been handling crucial orders received from the Indian armed forces and security forces. The OVF has been supplying arms to friendly foreign nations over the past three years. The stolen rifles were part of a consignment received by the factory for testing purposes.A senior Jalgaon Rural police officer said, ""We are focussing on identifying the possible route that the suspects may have taken to smuggle the rifles out of the high-security factory premises. It is highly unlikely that an outsider can know about the weapons stored in the factory without the help of an insider. We are investigating this angle."" Last week, the OFV authorities in association with various units of the Jalgaon Rural police and the security personnel of their own had carried out an extensive combing operation of the factory campus that is spread over 2,200 acres. The Defence Security Corps (DSC) and some private agencies are responsible for the security of the factory. ","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:09 IST","['city', 'pune']",114705001

Is the new 'One Piece Fan Letter' a spin-off canon or filler?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/web-series/news/english/is-the-new-one-piece-fan-letter-a-spin-off-canon-or-filler/articleshow/114705025.cms,"  The new 'One Piece Fan Letter' series that was released on October 20 has really made waves. This has created the question of whether the new series is canon or filler. In anime terms, filler refers to material that does not add to the plot and is often skipped many times without missing important plot points. So, is 'One Piece Fan Letter' canon? Of course, it is. Official sources state that 'Fan Letter' is a true canon spin-off series. In anime, a canon story is one that is directly derived from the source material. In this case, it would be the 'One Piece' manga and all related works. The 'One Piece Fan Letter' came from 'Straw Hat Stories', a spin-off novel that has already earned the seal of approval of the 'One Piece' creator, Eiichiro Oda.Since rumors about this new series spread after the anime was placed on hold until April 2025, people assumed that this one was also a filler. However, the 'One Piece Fan Letter' gives quite a different perspective on the daily life of the Straw Hat gang from the point of view of a normal fan, who incidentally is a girl attracted to Nami. What makes it different from high-stakes quests for One Piece is the refreshing view of the lives of the characters. Thus, we can conclude that 'One Piece Fan Letter' is canon and not filler. This is a thought-provoking addition to the 'One Piece' world, bringing readers new stories that Oda recognizes. For those so invested in the adventures of Straw Hats and looking for some new content, this spin-off is worthwhile because it expands the scope of the legend of 'One Piece'.","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:11 IST","['web-series', 'news', 'english']",114705025

Yadav claimed that the threat came amid his ‘closeness’ to Bollywood actor Salman Khan, whom the Bishnoi gang had earlier targeted.The threat call, suspected to have been made by jailed gangster Aman Sahu, who claims allegiance to the gang, came on the heels of Yadav attacking Bishnoi in a series of social media posts on Oct 13, a day after NCP neta Baba Siddique’s murder and the Bishnoi gang claiming responsibility for the killing.While dismissing the Bishnoi gang as a bunch of “insignificant thugs”, Yadav’s social media post had said, “If law permits, I will dismantle the entire network of a cheap criminal like Lawrence Bishnoi within 24 hours.”On Saturday, Yadav shot off a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, saying he received the death threat on his mobile phone from a member of the Bishnoi gang. “I am attaching a copy of the threat as evidence. Even after such a big threat to my life, the Centre and the state govt are not paying attention to my security,” he wrote. Yadav, who is provided with Y category security, requested Shah for an upgrade to Z.The call is said to have been made from a UAE number. Aman Sahu is currently incarcerated in a Ranchi jail while Bishnoi is lodged in Sabarmati Jail.In an audio clip provided by Yadav to mediapersons, which is still being verified by police, the MP is heard telling the caller that he had not attacked Bishnoi and that his post on X was a “political comment, made like any other political tweet would be, in response to a particular development”.Calling himself a “seven-time MP in Lok Sabha”, Yadav failed to hold the caller in awe, who shot back saying: “Hum karm bhi karte hain aur kand bhi”, while dismissing his self-endorsement as a veteran politician with a strong retort: “This is of little interest to us.”“Settle the matter as soon as possible. We considered you our brother, and you have embarrassed us,” the caller added.The call ended with Yadav assuring the caller, saying, “Aap befikr rahen (Rest assured, there won’t be any problem).”Police sources said the caller warned Yadav, asking him to stay away from the Salman Khan case and revealed that he was under close surveillance by the Bishnoi gang.“We are surveying and tracking your locations. Bishnoi bhai paid Rs 1 lakh per hour to block the jammers in Sabarmati Jail to connect with you over a call, and you failed to pick up,” the caller is heard saying in the audio clip.Purnia SP Kartikeya Kumar Sharma said, “We have heard about the incident through media. Police have been instructed to review the security arrangements of Yadav. Further investigation regarding the threat call is being initiated.” Bihar DGP Alok Raj refused to comment on the issue.In 2008, Yadav was convicted by a special court in the former MLA Ajit Sarkar murder case of 1998 and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was acquitted in 2013 by the Patna HC.Yadav recently met Baba Siddique’s son Zeeshan in Mumbai. He also expressed his desire to meet Salman Khan but was unable to do so due to the actor’s busy schedule."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 07:07 IST",['india'],114705355

Once done, place a small, clean table or platform and cover it with a red cloth. If by chance you don’t have red, it is alright to use yellow or orange cloth for the same. Now, arrange the idols and pictures of Lord Dhanvantari, Goddess Lakshmi, and Lord Kuber on the platform. Remember, Lord Dhanvantari is worshipped for health, Goddess Lakshmi for wealth, and Lord Kuber, the treasurer of wealth, for prosperity.Once everything is arranged, lightly sprinkle Gangajal all over to cleanse the space and the environment around you and light an incense stick to lighten the energies.The next step is to keep an oil diya on a plate in front of the idols. Fill the diya with mustard oil, or with ghee, and then light it. This diya will help any darkness away, from you and the home temple. After that, offer fresh flowers, preferably marigolds, to the Gods and Maa Lakshmi, and begin the puja.

You can chant the Lakshmi Stotram, the Lakshmi mata aarti, or the mantra ‘Om Dhan Dhanvantaraye Namah’. Another mantra for Maa Lakshmi is ‘Om Shreem Hreem Shree Lakshmi Bhyo Namah’.During the chanting, place a silver coin, or whatever you have bought on Dhanteras to receive the blessings of Maa Lakshmi, Lord Dhanvantari, and Lord Kuber. What to buy on DhanterasOne thing to remember when shopping on Dhanteras is that people should buy things according to their financial standing and their capabilities. There is no point burning a hole in your pocket just because popular culture dictates that you need to have a gold coin to please the Gods. And the buying guide for Dhanteras is rather simple too. For example, some people choose to buy gold and silver as these metals symbolise financial stability and are considered to attract wealth. Jewellry, coins, or even small items made of silver and gold are widely bought.Second are utensils. People stand hours in line to buy stainless steel or brass utensils and use them on the same day to make something for the family. People also buy a Gomti chakra on this day, a small, shell-like stone that is believed to bring positive energy into the home.And one of the most bought items on Dhanteras is a broom! In some traditions, buying a new broom on Dhanteras is said to be a symbol of sweeping away the negative energy and financial blockages from the home.

This Dhanteras, don’t forget to light diyas at the entrance of your home, and inside the home. The light from the diyas brings in positive energy and keeps darkness away.Along with that, try not to wear any black clothes in the 5-day Diwali festivities (including Dhanteras), as black is usually frowned upon during Hindu festivals.And one more thing to keep in mind is that if you plan to buy something on Dhanteras and you made the intention months ago that you will purchase on that day, try your best to not postpone the purchase or cancel it. Buy something during the Shubh Muhurat and bring it home for blessings and prosperity.

He mentioned that living in Mumbai allows their children to grow up in a more relaxed environment, giving them the chance to play freely and enjoy a normal childhood, away from the pressures of celebrity life. He further added that the shift has also helped Jyotika in her comeback as an actor.In a chat with The Hollywood Reporter India, Suriya revealed the motivations behind their relocation, emphasising the sacrifices Jyotika made for their relationship. He explained that she moved to Chennai at a young age, spent 27 years there, and gave up her career, friendships, and urban lifestyle in Bandra to be with him and his family. “Jyotika shifted to Chennai when she was 18 or 19 and lived there for 27 years. She was with me, my family, and she gave up her career, friends, and her Bandra lifestyle,” he stated.After the COVID-19 pandemic, they felt the need for a fresh change as Jyotika's career had stagnated, and the roles she was receiving lacked variety. This led them to establish 2D Entertainment, focusing on creating more women-centric films.Suriya highlighted the challenges Jyotika faces, noting that while he usually works with established directors, she often collaborates with newcomers. Since their relocation, Jyotika has taken on diverse projects like ‘Srikanth’, ‘Shaitaan’, ‘Dabba Cartel’, and ‘Kaathal: The Core’, which offer more engaging and innovative storytelling.Jyotika and Suriya hit the gym hard togetherThe ‘Ghajini’ actor discussed how relocating has benefited Jyotika both personally and professionally.

He mentioned that his kids are excelling in their IB school, a key reason for the move, as such schools are limited in Chennai. Balancing his time between the two cities, Suriya takes 10 days off each month to fully disconnect from work and enjoy peaceful moments in Mumbai. He expressed joy in spending quality time with his children, including playing basketball and exploring Hill Road with family, emphasizing the importance of kids experiencing life freely on the streets.Suriya and Jyotika first shared the screen in ‘Poovellam Kettuppar’ in 1999 and married in 2006.

""We were walking towards another rock, when I slipped, fell into the stream and was washed away,"" Hamsa told TOI from the hospital bed in Tumakuru, where she was recovering.Hamsa fell into the stream around 2.30 pm. Soon after, Keerthana dialled the police control room (112). A 16-member team from the Fire and Emergency Services, Tumakuru, and police from the Kyatasandra police station reached the spot, 62 km from Benglauru, around 3 pm.However, at 8.30 pm, the search had to be called off due to darkness.By the time the search-and-rescue operation resumed at the crack of dawn, police concluded that Hamsa could be stuck in one of the many crevices between the rocks.Around noon, the firemen found a crevice, eight feet long and six feet tall, filled with waist-high water. The crevice was located about 25 feet away from the spot where Hamsa had slipped into the water.As the rescue team members entered the crevice and called out Hamsa's name, they heard a feeble voice: ""I am Hamsa, please come this side.""Hamsa was finally extricated from the crevice at 12.30 pm, firemen said. She was given water and glucose, before being rushed to a govt hospital in Tumakuru as she had suffered bruises all over her body and was distraught after being stuck in the water for hours.","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:48 IST","['city', 'bengaluru']",114705353
Why do women crave chocolate during their period?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/why-do-women-crave-chocolate-during-their-period/articleshow/114705361.cms,"  Earlier this month (Oct 2024), a grocery delivery platform made headlines, for what the netizens described as a ‘genius marketing’ move after a woman shared a screenshot of a discount combo on the app for a packet of sanitary napkins and vanilla ice cream. While this generous discount might seem like a heartwarming gesture, it should be noted that the online grocer is banking on the age-old habit of women craving something sweet during their menstruation. So what’s with women and their period cravings? Among the confectionaries, chocolate in particular holds a special place. Why do women crave chocolate during their period? What causes these cravings, and is it necessary for them to give in?Though we have always believed that period cravings are linked to hormones, new studies suggest that there’s more to what meets the eye. Cravings and cultural factorsPic courtesy: iStockWhile many studies suggest that period cravings can be blamed on hormones, researchers now think that there are also cultural factors that contribute to this, rather than biology itself. More American women tend to crave chocolate, compared to other countries. According to a survey in 2006 of over 300 Cornell University students, it was learned that 91 percent of the female students craved chocolate. However, in other parts of the world, the chocolate craving is less. The study also surveyed 260 Spanish students from a university in Spain, and out of them, only 28 % craved chocolate during their period, compared to 49 percent of American women.In a 2019 study, it was found that among Japanese women, the most craved food during their period was rice, and only 19% craved chocolate. Similar studies suggest that craving chocolate is associated with something other than hormone balance. Several factors contribute to cravings in general, including eating habits. Cravings during periodsPic courtesy: iStockJust before the start of menstruation, the calorie intake increases, and the insulin resistance decreases, which makes it feel logical that these hormonal shifts could impact cravings. It has been believed that changes in levels of hormones estrogen and progesterone cause the cravings for high-carb and sweet foods prior to the period, however, when the scientists tried to find a link with cravings, no such link was found. Another study found that oral progesterone treatment too was no more effective than a placebo in reducing the cravings in menstruating women.Also, if the chocolate cravings were linked with menstruation, it should go away after menopause, however, no such data was found. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that postmenopausal women craved less than pre-menopausal women, however, the difference is quite a small fraction. This is where conditioned response and cultural significance come into play. A 2017 study comparing the chocolate cravings in US-born women and those born outside, found that the latter were less likely to have menstruation chocolate cravings.Breast Cancer In Indian Women: How Early Periods, Breast Density Among Multiple Factors Are Causing The Rise A study published in PLOS One, earlier this year found that women craving high-fat or sweet foods are more likely to experience PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or irregular cycles. Though indulging in a little sweet treat during menstruation cannot do harm, you should think of speaking with your doctor, if these cravings are strong, or the cramps are severe, or have mood swings, bloating, and anxiety.(Pic courtesy: iStock)","  Oct 29, 2024, 02:01 IST","['life-style', 'health-fitness', 'health-news']",114705361

The veteran spoke to People, describing the spontaneous, organic moments she felt along with the younger actors. Reminiscing the diner table scene with Raegan Revord in one episode, where while they were filming, she with her tiny hand kept touching the loose skin behind Potts' arm at the back. For Potts, that was a sweet moment of pure contact. Raegan felt “safe enough” around her to be so unguarded, something Potts cherished deeply, calling it the ""sweetest thing.""When Potts told another actress this experience, they questioned why she didn't ask Raegan to stop. In response, Potts said, “I went, ‘Stop. That’s gold. I would never stop her.” She said that events like these teach you how to be simple and real.Praising the child actors, she described them as “beautiful and sweet”. She felt she had a small hand in raising those kids and it turned out beautifully. She enjoyed talking about how, initially, they would sit on her lap, play with her fingers, kiss her, and tell her they loved her all day long. They even grew up, though too big for the lap at this point in time, the kiss and expression of love never ended, which Potts innocently quipped was ""not a bad way of living."".'Cobra Kai' Season 6: Part 2 Trailer: Ralph Macchio and William Zabka starrer 'Cobra Kai' Official Trailer","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:33 IST","['web-series', 'news', 'english']",114705229

"Veg, non-veg ‘controversy’ in Calcutta high court animal sacrifice hearing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/controversy-over-animal-sacrifice-in-calcutta-high-court-vegan-vs-non-vegan-debate/articleshow/114707729.cms," Calcutta high court KOLKATA: It was “really controversial” whether mythological characters were really vegetarian or non-vegetarian, a Calcutta High Court division bench observed on Monday while hearing a PIL seeking a ban on mass animal sacrifice at a temple in South Dinajpur, where 10,000 animals are ritually sacrificed every Nov. The HC referred the matter to the bench of Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam, which is hearing a clutch of similar pleas.The bench comprised Justice Biswajit Basu (who made the observation), along with Justice Ajay Kumar Gupta. It was hearing arguments to decide whether animal sacrifice was “essential religious practice”.The PIL was filed by the organisation Akhil Bharat Krishi Go Seva Sangh. The organisation sought urgent directions from the court to the Animal Welfare Board of India to stop illegal animal sacrifice “in the most gruesome and barbaric manner at various temples” in the state. When their counsel was asked whether they were seeking a ban in all temples, it was submitted that for now, they wanted the ban at one particular temple in South Dinajpur.“You need not challenge the validity of Section 28 (of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960) because the practice of sacrifice does not form an essential religious practice of Kali Puja or any other puja, so far as the citizens of eastern part of India follow. Food habits differ,” Justice Basu also remarked.The section that the judge was referring to says, “Nothing contained in this act shall render it an offence to kill any animal in a manner required by the religion of any community.”The bench refused to give any interim relief and referred the matter to the CJ’s bench.The petitioner’s counsel had earlier told the court that Bolla Kali Temple in South Dinajpur had a festival of ritually slaughtering more than 10,000 animals — including goats and buffalo — on a Friday after Rash Purnima every Nov. “This started sometime in the British era; there was a zamindar arrested by the Britishers. He prayed to Goddess Kali and was released on a Friday. The practice started thereafter,” the counsel had submitted.‘Sacrifice could take place symbolically’The counsel stressed that the practice did not come under “essential religious practice”, and, as such, did not have protection of Article 25 of the Constitution, which deals with the right to religious freedom subject to certain restrictions. The counsel highlighted that even if the sacrifice were to happen, it could happen “symbolically”.“Are you suggesting this is not part of religious practice?” Justice Basu questioned. Counsel replied by asking whether it was part of “essential” religious practice.Advocate general Kishore Datta, representing the state, questioned whether an application seeking astop to animal sacrifice in a particular temple could be treated as a PIL, as there was no “public interest” involved when it is “x (petitioner) vs y (temple authorities)”. Datta pointed out that similar questions came up before Supreme Court, wherein the top court had said, “If you need to restrict the sacrifice of animals, there has to be legislation brought to that effect.”The matter was ultimately referred to the regular bench by Justice Basu, to be considered with another petition filed on similar grounds.The organisation Reforms Social Welfare Foundation had challenged animal sacrifice in the name of god taking place in the state and sought interim orders.We also published the following articles recentlyThe Zodiac's Party AnimalsCertain zodiac signs like Gemini, Leo, Sagittarius, Aries, Aquarius, and Libra stand out as the ultimate party enthusiasts.

Preliminary probe indicates the surgeries were carried out in unhygienic conditions, the operation theatre was not sanitised, and there was fungus on the walls, said sources.The patients were brought to Raipur with pus oozing from their eyes.

Suriya says he moved to Mumbai to acknowledge Jyotika's sacrifices: 'She moved to Chennai when she was 18 and gave up her career',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/suriya-says-he-moved-to-mumbai-to-acknowledge-jyotikas-sacrifices-she-moved-to-chennai-when-she-was-18-and-gave-up-her-career/articleshow/114705093.cms,"  Kollywood’s most celebrated couple, Suriya and Jyotika, made a significant life choice by relocating to Mumbai after the pandemic.In a recent interview, Suriya shared that the move has brought a refreshing change for his family. He mentioned that living in Mumbai allows their children to grow up in a more relaxed environment, giving them the chance to play freely and enjoy a normal childhood, away from the pressures of celebrity life. He further added that the shift has also helped Jyotika in her comeback as an actor.In a chat with The Hollywood Reporter India, Suriya revealed the motivations behind their relocation, emphasising the sacrifices Jyotika made for their relationship. He explained that she moved to Chennai at a young age, spent 27 years there, and gave up her career, friendships, and urban lifestyle in Bandra to be with him and his family. “Jyotika shifted to Chennai when she was 18 or 19 and lived there for 27 years. She was with me, my family, and she gave up her career, friends, and her Bandra lifestyle,” he stated.After the COVID-19 pandemic, they felt the need for a fresh change as Jyotika's career had stagnated, and the roles she was receiving lacked variety. This led them to establish 2D Entertainment, focusing on creating more women-centric films.Suriya highlighted the challenges Jyotika faces, noting that while he usually works with established directors, she often collaborates with newcomers. Since their relocation, Jyotika has taken on diverse projects like ‘Srikanth’, ‘Shaitaan’, ‘Dabba Cartel’, and ‘Kaathal: The Core’, which offer more engaging and innovative storytelling.Jyotika and Suriya hit the gym hard togetherThe ‘Ghajini’ actor discussed how relocating has benefited Jyotika both personally and professionally. He shared that she enjoys reconnecting with her parents in Mumbai and emphasized the importance of women having vacations, friendships, financial independence, respect, and fitness time, just like men. He reflected on the need to move away from a self-centered mindset and expressed happiness in seeing his wife’s growth as an actress. “It’s important to shift our mindset from ‘I, me, and myself.’ I’m glad to see her growth as an actress, and I hope she finds even more beautiful opportunities,” he emphasized.He further shared how living in Mumbai has enriched his family life, allowing him to enjoy simple activities with his children, like park walks and drives. He mentioned that his kids are excelling in their IB school, a key reason for the move, as such schools are limited in Chennai. Balancing his time between the two cities, Suriya takes 10 days off each month to fully disconnect from work and enjoy peaceful moments in Mumbai. He expressed joy in spending quality time with his children, including playing basketball and exploring Hill Road with family, emphasizing the importance of kids experiencing life freely on the streets.Suriya and Jyotika first shared the screen in ‘Poovellam Kettuppar’ in 1999 and married in 2006. They have two kids, Diya and Dev.On the work front, Suriya has the most awaited 'Kanguva' set to release on November 14."," Updated: Oct 31, 2024, 06:53 IST","['entertainment', 'hindi', 'bollywood', 'news']",114705093
Student sets self afire amid Uttarakhand stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/student-sets-self-afire-amid-uttarakhand-stir/articleshow/114707730.cms,"  Almora/Dehradun: A 23-year-old MSc student from Almora’s Soban Singh Jeena (SSJ) University set himself on fire on Monday as part of ongoing protests against the state govt’s decision to cancel student union elections in colleges and universities this year.Deepak Lohani, a candidate for the president’s post in the student union at the university, sustained 15% burns, primarily on his hands, stomach, and chest, said doctors.The incident occurred during a protest at Chaughanpata, where Rahul Dhami, the university’s current student union president poured petrol on himself. As police tried to de-escalate the situation, Lohani, also a member of the same students’s group, set himself on fire after dousing himself with petrol. Police quickly extinguished the flames and rushed Lohani to the district hospital, where he is currently receiving treatment.The issue of students’ elections has been simmering for almost a month ever since the deadline given by the state govt to universities for conducting the elections passed. The govt had issued an academic calendar on April 23, directing that student union elections be conducted by Sept 30. However, some of the university administrations failed to organise the elections within the specified time. The matter reached the Uttarakhand high court (HC) where a PIL was filed requesting the HC to intervene in getting the student union elections to be held. However, the PIL was dismissed on Oct 24 after the HC accepted the state govt’s contention that it is too late into the academic session to hold the elections.In Almora, student organisations had given the call for a protest rally in the Chaughanpata area where they intended to burn effigies of state education minister Dhan Singh Rawat. This came as Amit Bisht, an NSUI member, announced on Saturday that he would self-immolate if demands were not met by Monday. The protest quickly escalated, leading to Dhami and Lohani’s self-immolation attempts. They warned the govt “not to test their patience” and vowed to keep fighting saying they will “force the state to yield”.Dhan Singh Rawat said, “We have sought response from the universities. A double bench of the HC had passed the order to not go against the recommendations of the Lyngdoh Committee, which says that student union elections should be held between six to eight weeks after a new academic session starts. Now the students may approach Supreme Court to challenge the HC’s order because universities cannot go against it or the Lyngdoh Committee.”Meanwhile, students from other districts also converged in Dehradun on Monday and marched from Congress Bhawan in the state capital to the secretariat. Another group of students from colleges in Dehradun also held a “funeral march” for Rawat by taking out a procession from DAV college to the secretariat.Students said that the last polls were also held after a two-month delay, making the decision to cancel it this year an “undemocratic move”.“If the admissions were postponed and the last admission was conducted till Sept 25, then preparation should have been made to postpone the elections too,” said Pradeep Singh Tomar, national coordinator (Uttarakhand), NSUI. Earlier, on Oct 18, angry over the college’s failure to announce the date for student union elections, three students from Haldwani’s Moti Ram Babu Ram Government Post Graduate College had climbed on the roof of the principal’s office and threatened self-immolation after pouring diesel on themselves. Later, the students issued an apology for their act.Elsewhere in Dehradun, students have set up tents outside DAV College and Dayanand Brijendra Swarup College, where they have been camping since Friday. Several colleges in the district have also been forced to shut down due to the agitation.","  Oct 29, 2024, 04:12 IST",['india'],114707730

‘Friendly fight’ in 7 constituencies likely as MVA allies declare names for same seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/maharashtras-mva-allies-set-for-friendly-fight-in-key-constituencies/articleshow/114705042.cms,"  Kolhapur: At least two allies of the Mahavikas Aghadi (MVA) have officially nominated their candidates in seven assembly constituencies of Maharashtra.These constituencies include Digras in Yavatmal district, Malegaon Central in Nashik, Paranda in Dharashiv, and Sangola and Solapur South in Solapur district. Additionally, the MVA faces a dilemma over Miraj in Sangli district, Patan in Satara district, and Solapur City Central in Solapur which are strongly being claimed by at least two alliance partners. The party leadership is likely to allow a ""friendly contest"" on these seats if neither of the candidates withdraw their nominations. The MVA is an alliance of major parties such as Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and NCP (SCP), along with minor players like the Samajwadi Party, CPI (M), Peasants and Workers Party of India, among others. While speaking in Baramati, NCP (SCP) president Sharad Pawar was asked about two MVA parties officially nominating their candidates on the same seat. He replied, ""We have asked the candidates to fill up the nominations. There is time for withdrawal, and we are engaged in discussions to resolve the issue. Seat sharing for almost 90-95% of the seats in Maharashtra has been concluded.""According to sources, top functionaries of the MVA are against any ""friendly fight"" as it may lead to the emergence of this trend elsewhere, potentially destabilising the alliance. However, the local office-bearers are demanding a friendly fight, especially where the declared candidate is not suitable for the ally partners. For instance, Sena (UBT) functionaries from Kolhapur have appealed to party president Uddhav Thackeray to allow a local office-bearer to contest, even as an independent, to secure one MLA in UBT's basket.Sena (UBT) functionary Sanjay Raut, while speaking in Mumbai on Monday, had said, ""Congress and NCP (SCP) have declared their candidates. I consider it a typing mistake. Such mistakes can happen from our side as well. For Digras, we have decided to withdraw and leave the seat for Manikrao Thakare. Congress has left Daryapur seat for Sena (UBT). In Paranda, between Sena (UBT) and NCP (SCP), there is a little misconception. We are resolving the issue. In South Solapur, Congress has announced its candidate and in Miraj, they are considering it. If this happens, it will affect other constituencies, and MVA will face difficulties. Therefore, we have decided to discuss and find a way out.""","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:12 IST","['city', 'kolhapur']",114705042

"Upholding right to liberty and speedy trial, HC grants bail in PMLA case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upholding-right-to-liberty-and-speedy-trial-hc-grants-bail-in-pmla-case/articleshow/114705282.cms,"  NEW DELHI: Granting bail to two men recently in a money laundering case, Delhi high court has ruled that the stringent twin tests for grant of bail under Section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) cannot be invoked as a tool to indefinitely detain accused persons when there is a delay in completing the trial.“The right of liberty and speedy trial guaranteed under Article 21 is a sacrosanct right which needs to be protected and duly enforced even in cases where stringent provisions have been made applicable by way of special legislation. The stringent provisions will have to be interpreted with due regard to Article 21, and in case of a conflict, the stringent provisions, such as Section 45 of PMLA in the instant case, will have to give way,” said the court.The court made the remark while granting bail to two former Bhushan Steel Limited (BSL) officials, Pankaj Kumar Tewari and Pankaj Kumar – vice-presidents in finance and accounts departments of BSL, respectively – who were booked in connection with a Rs 46,000-crore money laundering case. The two officials have been accused of aiding the ex-promoters of BSL, the main accused, in the case.The two got bail after over nine months in jail. The court took note of the fact that the main accused and similarly placed co-accused had already been given bail.Observing that the case involved numerous defendants, extensive evidence spanning lakhs of pages and many witnesses, due to which the trial was unlikely to conclude anytime soon for no fault of the accused, the court said: “When there are multiple accused persons, lakhs of pages of evidence to assess (and) scores of witnesses to be examined, the trial is not expected to end anytime in the near future. Importantly, the delay being not attributable to the accused, keeping the accused in custody by using Section 45 PMLA as a tool for incarceration is not permissible. The flow of liberty cannot be dammed by Section 45 without taking all other germane considerations into account. It is the duty of constitutional courts to champion the constitutional cause of liberty and uphold the majesty of Article 21.”“Constitutional courts can always exercise their powers to grant bail on the grounds of violation of Part III of Constitution of India, and stringent provisions for the grant of bail, such as those provided in Section 45 of the PMLA, do not take away the power of constitutional courts to do so,” said the court.The court reiterated that “bail is the rule and jail is the exception” in view of Article 21, adding, “Liberty is the usual course of action, and deprivation of it a detour, which is why there are safeguards imposed to ensure that the deprivation of liberty is only by procedure established by law.”","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:43 IST",['india'],114705282

During this period, all govt recruitments will be put on hold. “The government has made a bold move to fulfil the long-pending demand of a section of SCs for internal reservation. Once the commission submits its report, we will take further steps,” said law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil.The newly formed commission will collect updated empirical data to base its recommendations. “From today, if any recruitment is to be notifi ed, that process will not take place. It will only start after the commission submits its report,” Patil said.This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that empowered state govts to offer internal reservation for SCs based on empirical data.SC quota: No clarity on whether panel will refer to caste censusThere is still ambiguity over whether the commission will refer to findings from the long-awaited caste census or rely on the 2011 exercise as data source.“You will come to know about it when we issue terms of reference to the commission,” minister HC Mahadevappa said, reflecting the uncertainty.The demand for internal reservation, championed by SC groups primarily from the Left sect, has been a topic of debate for over two decades. These groups argue that a few sects among the SCs monopolize reservation benefits, leaving others, particularly the severely backward ones, disadvantaged. To address these concerns, the BJP government had set up the Justice AJ Sadashiva Commission, which submitted its report in 2012 recommending internal reservations. It proposed classifying the 101 SC subcastes into four categories — Right, Left, Touchables, and Others — to ensure fairer distribution of quotas.Ahead of the 2023 assembly elections, the previous BJP government led by Basavaraj Bommai introduced internal reservations for SCs, allotting 6% to SC (Left), 5.5% to SC (Right), 4.5% to SC (Touchables), and 1% to SC (Others). However, this move faced criticism as politically motivated.The Supreme Court’s Aug 1 verdict was significant in this development. A seven-judge constitution bench, led by CJI DY Chandrachud, ruled 6-1 in favour of allowing states to make sub-classifications within SCs for reservation purposes. This overturned a 2004 judgment that had barred such sub-classifications, considering SCs as a homogeneous group."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 08:40 IST","['city', 'bengaluru']",114705351

The court is being asked to intervene in a dispute regarding provisional ballots cast by Pennsylvania voters whose mail ballots are disqualified for not adhering to technical procedures outlined in state law, just over a week before the election.In a 4-3 decision, the state's high court ruled that elections officials are required to count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were invalidated because they were received without the mandatory secrecy envelopes. On the same day, Virginia also sought the Supreme Court's intervention in a dispute concerning the purging of voter registrations. The high court had previously weighed in on pandemic-related changes to voting rules in several states, including Pennsylvania, four years ago.Republicans, in their filing to the high court, requested an order to either put the state court ruling on hold or, alternatively, to require the segregation of provisional ballots and exclude them from the official vote count while the legal battle continues. They contended that the legislature did not make provisions for allowing voters to rectify mistakes on ballots they submit by mail.","  Oct 29, 2024, 02:03 IST","['world', 'us']",114705418

Terror book author behind hoax emails to airlines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/terror-book-author-behind-hoax-emails-to-airlines/articleshow/114706785.cms,"  NAGPUR: A 35-year-old resident of the Maoist-affected Gondia district in Maharashtra’s eastern Vidarbha region, has been identified as the source of a series of hoax emails that caused alarm, flight delays, and increased security measures at airports, airline offices, and railway stations. Jagdish Uikey, who has written a book on terrorism, claims to have deciphered a secret terror code (25-MBA-5-MTR) that foretells 30 explosions on trains and railway premises over the course of five days.Uikey, who was once nabbed in 2021, is on the run since the hoax emails were traced to him.Top security agency sources told TOI that Uikey had sent emails to various government agencies, including the Prime Minister's Office, Union railway minister, Maharashtra CM and his deputy, airline offices, DGP, and railway protection force. On Monday, Nagpur police increased security outside the Trikoni Park residence of deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis, following Uikey's threat to stage a protest unless he was granted a hearing on the secret terror code. He also requested a meeting with PM Modi to discuss the details he claimed to have regarding the alleged terror attacks.Uikey's email to Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnav on October 21, which was also sent to the DGP and RPF, led to heightened security and anti-terror measures at railway stations.","  Oct 29, 2024, 03:45 IST",['india'],114706785
"Penalty must be proportionate to charges, HC cites Ashoka",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/penalty-must-be-proportionate-to-charges-hc-cites-ashoka/articleshow/114707488.cms,"  BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Punishment should be proportionate to the charge, Madhya Pradesh high court (HC) observed while cancelling the termination of a Bhopal Development Authority (BDA) employee, noting that he was dismissed without proper enquiry while his colleagues facing similar charges were exonerated. Referring to a 'shloka', Justice Sanjay Dwivedi said in a recent order, ""Let the king inflict punishments upon the guilty (i) corresponding to the nature (gravity) of the offence (ii) according to justice and (iii) not pardon anyone who has committed the offence for the second time.""""In the first separate rock edict of Emperor Ashoka at Dhauli, he expressed his anxiety that undeserved and harsh punishment should not be imposed,"" the judge remarked, ordering BDA to reinstate the petitioner, Vijay Singh Yadav, with back wages and other benefits.HC said the punishment was based on the ""opinion of the enquiry officer"" and not only the disciplinary authority but the appellate authority, too, stuck to it without following the law or principle of natural justice. Not a single witness was examined in the enquiry, the HC pointed out.Yadav was a BDA revenue officer in 2015 when he was accused of making some changes to the lease deed of a piece of land at ISBT-Bhopal which caused financial loss to BDA. He was suspended and issued a notice in 2016. Yadav replied to the notice and moved HC, challenging the action against him.HC asked Yadav to approach the BDA appellate authority, which upheld the order to sack him without giving him a hearing, his petition stated. After hearing both sides, Justice Dwivedi cited an HC order stating: ""The doctrine of proportionality exists in India from time immemorial. It is applied by courts in criminal cases on a regular basis. The principle is that one cannot be visited with an extreme order/punishment which is not commensurate with the conduct/misconduct /offence.""Citing an SC order, the HC said that getting a copy of the enquiry report is the right of the delinquent when the enquiry officer is not the disciplinary authority, but in this case, the petitioner was neither given the enquiry report nor told why. Thereby, the petitioner was denied a reasonable opportunity to prove his innocence."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 04:07 IST",['india'],114707488

"Microsoft-Google fight is out in the open: Microsoft exec writes 'open letter' against Google, claims attacking company on a range of topics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-google-fight-is-out-in-the-open-microsoft-exec-writes-open-letter-against-google-claims-attacking-company-on-a-range-of-topics/articleshow/114705274.cms," This is a representational image Microsoft has leveled serious accusations against Google, alleging that the search giant is orchestrating a ""shadow campaign"" to undermine Microsoft's cloud business, Azure. In a scathing blog post, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, Rima Alaily, revealed that Google is on the verge of launching a new lobbying group designed to discredit Azure.Microsoft claims that Google has hired a European lobbying firm to establish this new organization, which is set to be unveiled this week. The software giant claims to have learned of this campaign through an unnamed European cloud provider who declined to participate and subsequently alerted Microsoft.This latest development comes shortly after Google filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft with EU regulators in September. In its complaint, Google accused Microsoft of unfair licensing practices for Azure. This move followed Microsoft's settlement with CISPE, a group of European cloud infrastructure providers who had previously raised similar concerns about Microsoft's licensing terms.Microsoft alleges that Google actively attempted to thwart its settlement with CISPE in July. The company suggests that this recent escalation of hostilities between the two tech giants may signal a return to the intense rivalry that characterized their past interactions, reminiscent of the ""Scroogled"" campaign and disputes over Google services on Windows Phone.Here's the complete blog post written by Rima Alaily, CVP, Deputy General Counsel, MicrosoftSince moving into my current role at Microsoft almost seven years ago, I’ve worked hard to be genuine, responsive, and transparent. I’ve taken pains to tell the truth, even when that might make things more complicated for Microsoft. I think, and hope people I’ve engaged with – including reporters, and regulators – would say the same. It’s not comfortable or natural for me to pen something critical of someone else, but in this case, I think it’s important because it concerns me when someone attacks us and, I believe, does so dishonestly.This week an astroturf group organized by Google is launching. It is designed to discredit Microsoft with competition authorities, and policymakers and mislead the public. Google has gone through great lengths to obfuscate its involvement, funding, and control, most notably by recruiting a handful of European cloud providers, to serve as the public face of the new organization. When the group launches, Google, we understand, will likely present itself as a backseat member rather than its leader. It remains to be seen what Google offered smaller companies to join, either in terms of cash or discounts.This latest effort comes on the heels of their recent failure to weaponize another organization – CISPE – against Microsoft. In July, when CISPE was on the verge of resolving its complaint against Microsoft, Google offered CISPE’s members a combination of cash and credits amounting to an eye-popping $500 million to reject the settlement and continue pursuing litigation. Wisely, they declined. And, instead, the CISPE members endorsed the resolution we had developed together.Google’s tactics, unfortunately, go beyond creating astroturf lobbying organizations. They’re also speaking out in their own name in disingenuous ways and putting forward paid commentators to discredit us. Why? I suspect much has to do with the fact that Google is facing a reckoning. Never in the past two decades have Google’s search, digital advertising, and mobile app store monopolies faced such a concerted and determined threat as they do today. By our count, there are at least 24 antitrust investigations against Google in the leading digital markets around the world. At a time when Google should be focused on addressing legitimate questions about its business, it is instead turning its vast resources towards tearing down others. It is disappointing that, with the foundation of their business facing jeopardy, they have sought to bolster their cloud computing service – Google Cloud Platform – by attacking ours.It seems Google has two ultimate goals in its astroturfing efforts: distract from the intense regulatory scrutiny Google is facing around the world by discrediting Microsoft and tilt the regulatory landscape in favor of its cloud services rather than competing on the merits.Google’s new European astroturf lobbying organizationWe recently learned that, following its rejection by CISPE, Google pivoted to stand up its own astroturf lobbying organization. It hired a lobbying and communications agency in Europe to create and operate the organization. And it recruited several small European cloud providers to join. One of the companies approached, who ultimately declined, told us that the organization will be directed and largely funded by Google for the purpose of attacking Microsoft’s cloud computing business in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Of course, the innocuous recruitment document omits any mention of Google’s involvement and the actual purpose of the organization. We have been informed that the organization will be led by Nicky Stewart, who personally penned complaints against Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the UK Competition and Market Authority’s ongoing investigation into the cloud computing market. In September, Google took an unusual step and publicly announced that it had filed a formal complaint concerning Microsoft’s software licensing practices for the cloud with the European Commission. Most such complaints are submitted confidentially, but Google took the opportunity to broadcast its concerns. Although it suggests that Google is acting to protect the interests of European customers, its complaint reads differently. Fundamentally, Google’s argument is that it should not have to pay Microsoft when it builds and offers cloud services using our intellectual property – namely Windows Server – if customers have otherwise purchased the same software for a very different use, i.e., on their own server. We disagree. When a streaming service, like Netflix or Disney, includes a movie in their service, they pay for that right. They don’t get a credit or discount if a subscriber happens to own a DVD of the same movie. Software and the cloud are no different.Google is also continuing, directly and through proxies, to lobby competition authorities around the world to intervene and impose restrictions on its hyperscale cloud competitors, but not itself. Google argues that it should be treated as a non-hyperscale or small cloud provider; in effect, it asserts that it is not in the same category as AWS and Microsoft. This strains credibility. Google may have been late in meeting the needs of enterprise customers, but it is fully capable of competing head-to-head with AWS and Microsoft. It does not need competition authorities to put a thumb on the scale in its favor. Google is a leader in datacenter capacity, with an operational capacity of 3,500 MW in 2023, more than any other provider. As one of the world’s most valuable companies, last quarter it achieved 29% growth rate in its cloud business and invested $13 billion to grow its infrastructure. We hope Google does not prevail in misleading competition authorities, because the companies with most to lose from this would be every other non-hyperscale cloud provider across the globe and the customers we all serve.Google’s pattern of shadowy campaignsIn Europe and in the U.S., Google has taken a page out of its decades-long playbook for litigating against antitrust enforcers. It is funding – directly and indirectly – various industry commentators and academics to attack Microsoft and author “studies” that can be cited to discredit us. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter at the United States Department of Justice recently condemned tactics like these as undermining true expertise and antitrust enforcement. Indeed, these commentators often misrepresent their credentials or mask their affiliation with to appear as neutral experts.Just recently one of these commentators published an op-ed calling for regulatory intervention and echoing Google’s arguments, citing past ties to Microsoft and Google, perhaps to seem impartial. We took note, since we had not worked with the author for many years and had no current relationship. After we raised the issue with the publication, it updated the article to properly disclose the author’s affiliation with a private consulting firm which has counted Google as a client.Europe is not the only jurisdiction where Google is engaged in these tactics, nor is software licensing for the cloud the only topic Google is using to attack us behind the scenes.We understand Google is a main funder of the U.S.-based Coalition for Fair Software Licensing, which has levied attacks on our cloud computing business in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the EU. The organization is run by a well-known lobbyist for Google in Washington DC, but Google’s affiliation isn’t disclosed publicly by the organization.Google has also attacked us on topics ranging from cybersecurity to our business in China, pitching stories to reporters, suggesting questions to congressional offices ahead of hearings, and distributing documents in major capitals around the world. Earlier this year, Google distributed a “fact sheet” in Washington DC attempting to drum up concerns about our approach to the Chinese market. The document is misleading and filled with inaccuracies, which we attempted to raise directly with Google leadership with no resolution.Google’s work on this range of topics underscores the fact that it is less concerned about Microsoft’s conduct in the cloud market than it is with discrediting a competitor wherever it can get a foothold.Microsoft’s approachWe are always listening when it comes to our products, licensing, and business strategy, which is why we try to respond to genuine feedback from customers, partners, and regulators and make swift changes.This was the basis of our offer to CISPE members. Having previously agreed to collaborate on a technology solution to address market challenges they faced. It was logical at the time – and continues to be – that we did not make the same changes for hyperscale providers like Google and Amazon who are very differently situated in the marketplace.This was also the basis of the changes we proactively made to our popular business and enterprise productivity suites last year: creating versions without Teams – at a lower price – to expand choice given the concerns raised by the European Commission.We’ve made these changes, and others, not because we believed we were doing something improper but because we understand that the role and responsibility that we have as an important global technology company and the heightened expectations that governments, regulators, policymakers, customers and partners have of us.We will continue to listen and evolve when we hear credible, legitimate, and addressable concerns, but as Google continues to demonstrate with its actions, the arguments it wants you to believe are none of these."," Updated: Oct 30, 2024, 10:09 IST","['technology', 'tech-news']",114705274
"Shariat Council not a court, husband must get legal stamp on talaq: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shariat-council-not-a-court-husband-must-get-legal-stamp-on-talaq-hc/articleshow/114705173.cms,"  MADURAI: Shariat Council is a private organisation and not a court, Madurai bench of Madras HC ruled recently while hearing a civil revision petition regarding the triple talaq of a Muslim doctor couple who married in 2010.One of the focal points of the case is Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath, the Shariat Council, issuing a divorce certificate to the husband in 2017. Though it can help resolve family and financial issues, it can’t issue divorce certificates or enforce penalties.Justice G R Swaminathan criticised the divorce certificate, describing it as “shocking”.He said the council had accepted the husband’s petition for triple talaq and attempted to mediate, but blamed the wife for not cooperating.“Only courts duly constituted by the state can deliver judgments. Shariat Council is a private body and not a court,” the judge reiterated, dismissing the husband’s revision petition. “So long as such a declaration has not been obtained from the jurisdictional court, the marriage is deemed to subsist.”In 2018, the wife disputed the divorce and filed a petition under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act before a Tirunelveli judicial magistrate court. She also asserted that the third talaq was not served on her, meaning the marriage was still valid. The husband married a second time that year.In 2021, the magistrate ruled in favour of the first wife, directing the husband to pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation for domestic violence and Rs 25,000 a month for the maintenance of their minor child. Later, a sessions court dismissed the husband’s appeal against this decision, prompting him to file the current revision petition before the HC.During the hearing, Justice Swaminathan said the husband claimed to have properly pronounced talaq three times. “If it is disputed by the wife, the question arises if the marriage has been validly dissolved. So long as such a declaration has not been obtained from the jurisdictional court, the marriage is deemed to subsist,” the judge observed.The HC said the husband must go to the court and obtain a declaration. “The issue cannot be left to the unilateral determination of the husband since that would amount to the husband becoming a judge of his own cause,” the judge observed.The judge said the act of bigamy caused “considerable emotional distress and pain” to the wife, amounting to cruelty.“If a Hindu, Christian, Parsi, or Jewish husband contracts a second marriage during the subsistence of the first marriage, it would constitute cruelty besides being an offence of bigamy. It would obviously be considered an act of domestic violence entitling the wife to claim compensation under Section 12 of the Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Will this proposition apply in the case of Muslims? The answer is yes,” Justice Swaminathan said.","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:29 IST",['india'],114705173

The court is being asked to intervene in a dispute regarding provisional ballots cast by Pennsylvania voters whose mail ballots are disqualified for not adhering to technical procedures outlined in state law, just over a week before the election.In a 4-3 decision, the state's high court ruled that elections officials are required to count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were invalidated because they were received without the mandatory secrecy envelopes. On the same day, Virginia also sought the Supreme Court's intervention in a dispute concerning the purging of voter registrations. The high court had previously weighed in on pandemic-related changes to voting rules in several states, including Pennsylvania, four years ago.Republicans, in their filing to the high court, requested an order to either put the state court ruling on hold or, alternatively, to require the segregation of provisional ballots and exclude them from the official vote count while the legal battle continues. They contended that the legislature did not make provisions for allowing voters to rectify mistakes on ballots they submit by mail.","  Oct 29, 2024, 02:03 IST","['world', 'us', 'us-presidential-elections']",114705445

In first round of Pawar vs Pawar during the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, Ajit Pawar had pitted his wife, Sunetra, against cousin Supriya Sule of NCP. Sunetra lost the battle.After Yugendra, accompanied by Sharad Pawar, filed his nomination papers on Monday, Ajit Pawar said, ""I admitted (after the LS elections) that it was my mistake to field a candidate against a family member (Supriya Sule). Now, they (Sharad Pawar's party) have fielded a family member against me and committed the same mistake. They should have avoided the mistake.""Addressing a gathering at Kanheri village soon after filing his papers, Ajit Pawar said his mother, Ashatai Pawar, advised the other faction of the Pawar family not to field a candidate against him. ""During difficult times, my mother held the family together. Despite my mother's advice, who took the call to field the candidate against me? It's said to be (Sharad) Pawar Saheb's call. Does that mean Pawar Saheb has created a split in our family?"" he said.The deputy CM said, ""The level of politics has gone down. Bonding in a family is built over generations. But it takes hardly any time to break a family. Differences in the family should remain within the four walls. Once there is a split, it is difficult to bridge the gap.""Ajit Pawar's younger brother, Shrinivas Pawar, however, refuted his claim. He said, ""As per my knowledge, my mother never made such a statement. She never told me anything like that. He (Ajit Pawar) knows what he's saying. During the Lok Sabha elections, I was pursuing him not to field a candidate against Supriya.

The Mahayuti of BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP has finalised candidates for 275 seats out of the total 288 while the MVA of Congress, NCP (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT) has decided on 276.This is the first election in recent decades when parties have been unable to finalise nominees for all seats until the penultimate day, an indication of how fraught seat-sharing talks have been between parties in both the alliances.On Monday, BJP, Congress, Sena and NCP (SP) announced fresh lists of candidates. With this, BJP has declared the largest number of candidates (146), followed by Congress (103), Sena-UBT (85), Sena (80), Sharad Pawar-led NCP (76), and NCP (49).Maharashtra Pradesh Congress chief Nana Patole said MVA had only a few seats left to finalise and he was sure that it would be done Tuesday. A BJP neta said his party, too, would close nomination exercise Tuesday morning. ""Several parties are involved in negotiations; as a result, there is an inordinate delay in finalising nominations,"" Patole said.Former Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap said it was an unprecedented situation. ""I have been seeing LS and assembly polls, and I have also seen coalition politics, but it's the first time that we have not been able to finalise nominations even at this stage,"" Jagtap said.A former CM said both alliances are unwieldy with half a dozen parties in each of them competing for stakes. Rebel candidates who refuse to give up their claim to a specific seat, are present on a large scale. ""We may be discussing the political situation at state level, but there are several local-level workers who do not recognise authority of their bosses. As a result, rebellion is bound to happen. The biggest challenge before the political leadership will be to tackle rebels (sic),"" he said.He felt friendly fights may be the only viable solution for tackling rebels. ""Whether it is BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, or both NCPs, there are rebels in each party who will certainly win,"" he said.

Handling tasks with patience and a systematic approach will yield positive results, earning you the respect of colleagues and superiors.Money and Finance:Financially, today calls for careful budgeting and a close watch on unnecessary expenditures.

Instead, consider assessing your financial goals and making a plan for future stability. Although today might feel like a setback, practicing financial discipline will prevent further issues and help you regain control over your finances.Health and Well-being:Your mental and emotional health might feel slightly strained, especially if interpersonal tensions arise.

Vidya Balan opens up about her drastic weight loss: 'This is the first year that I have not...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/vidya-balan-opens-up-about-her-drastic-weight-loss-this-is-the-first-year-that-i-have-not-/articleshow/114705750.cms,"  Vidya Balan, who is busy with the promotions of her upcoming film ‘Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3’, has made headlines this year for her remarkable weight loss. She gained the stunning transformation by altering her diet and, in an unexpected move, quitting all exercise. The actress recently talked candidly about her experience and revealed details about her body image and the emotional challenges she encountered growing up as a “fat girl.”During a conversation with Galatta India, Vidya reflected on her lifelong battle with weight. The actress shared, “You know, all my life, I have struggled to be thin. I have dieted and exercised like crazy, and sometimes, I would lose weight, and it would come back.” But early this year when she got in touch with Chennai's Amura Health, a nutritional organization, everything changed. They determined that inflammation, not excess fat, was the cause of her weight problems. “They put me on a diet to get rid of the inflammation,” she explained. She discovered that even supposedly healthful veggies like spinach and bottle gourd may work against her, even though she had always been a vegetarian.Vidya also disclosed that a significant change in her fitness regimen was a component of her weight loss journey. “They asked me to stop working out,” she said. For someone who had previously pushed herself at the gym, this was a big adjustment. She revealed, ""This is the first year that I haven't worked out.""The actress said, ""Judgment around the body is brutal,"" in reference to the social pressures surrounding body appearance. She admitted that emotional causes are among the many reasons why people frequently gain weight. She ended with a strong statement on accepting oneself and the value of identifying one's own wants. “No two people are the same… we must respect our individuality,” she said.On the work front, Vidya Balan is gearing up for the release of her upcoming horror-comedy film ‘Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3’. It is scheduled to hit the theatres on Diwali. The film also stars Kartik Aaryan and Madhuri Dixit.Vidya Balan Turns Stage Fall into a Highlight of 'Ami Je Tomar 3.0'","  Oct 29, 2024, 02:48 IST","['entertainment', 'hindi', 'bollywood', 'news']",114705750

He's also a former head of the state planning commission.He told TOI that a ""campaign of negativity"" was run against him in the 2019 polls. ""That's why I lost, but I kept working. A lot of funds were brought in for the development of Kolhapur city. The long-pending issue among KMC's daily wage workers was resolved by getting them permanent jobs.

The manga published two volumes.The most recent one came out in March 2024. Several of them are adaptations of Kumo Kagyu's dark fantasy light novel series demonstrated by Noboru Kannatsuki. The original light novel follows the story of a mysterious adventurer known as Goblin Slayer, whose aim is to kill all the goblins in the world. The series focuses on the reason behind the obsessive nature of his character by highlighting his extreme devotion towards his work which draws the attention of fellow adventurers.The light novel series quickly gained extreme popularity, giving rise to other adaptations: the main manga, which has been directly taken from it and has even further elaborated the main storylines. It contains 15 volumes to date. Even an anime version was given to it. This anime captured so many dark themes and how the adventure is a whole new way through battles of goblins. The audience is now looking forward to the last pages of the 'Goblin Slayer: A Day in the Life' series. Compared to the major arcs in the series, this is one of those spin-offs that would talk about a character's life and routine more. The audience hopes to know how the story will be concluded in its final pages and how much will it cover the personality of Goblin Slayer.","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:45 IST","['web-series', 'news', 'english']",114705199
Bambiha syndicate is the newest entrant in Delhi’s crowded crime landscape,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bambiha-syndicate-is-the-newest-entrant-in-delhis-crowded-crime-landscape/articleshow/114705237.cms,"  NEW DELHI: Delhi cops are on their toes with the initial investigation into a firing incident at a businessman’s house in northwest Delhi’s Rani Bagh pointing towards the possible involvement of the Bambiha syndicate. This marks a third entrant into Delhi’s mafiadom, which is already plagued by the Lawrence Bishnoi and Himanshu Bhau gangs.While Bishnoi managed to gun down businessman Nadir Shah in an area like Greater Kailash-I, Bhau has been cocking a snook at Delhi cops with incidents like a murder in a crowded Burger King restaurant and multiple shooting incidents at car showrooms in the capital.The Bambihas are arch-rivals of Lawrence Bishnoi. Bishnoi, it is believed, decided to kill Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala after he released a song titled ‘Bambiha Bole’, a cop who interrogated Bishnoi last year recalled.The leadership of the Bambihas is scattered after its kingpin, Davinder Bambiha, was killed in an encounter with police in 2016. While jailed gangster Kaushal Chaudhary has been overseeing the affairs of the gang along with his associates Amit Dagar, Fateh Nagri and others, fugitive Gaurav, alias Lucky Patial, is heading the group from the US or Armenia. Until now, the group was active in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.Police are particularly alarmed by the development because of the close association of the Bambihas with pro-Khalistan factions, including Khalistan Tiger Force. After the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, KTF’s new chief, Arsh Dala, has been working closely with the Bambihas. In 2022, Dala orchestrated the murder of a Hindu man in Delhi as a ‘test task’ for his two henchmen — Naushad and Jagga — who wanted to make it big.A dossier on the Bambihas says that while terrorising people through extortion, intimidation and killings, the group has subsequently associated with Pro-Khalistani elements and extremists. “Despite being apprehended under organised crime acts like MCOCA and jailed, most of these gangsters flourished while operating from behind bars. While in jail, they transformed into militants and created a deadly terror-criminal nexus, which is not only susceptible to exploitation by external forces inimical to India but also dangerous to national security,” reads the dossier.According to a chargesheet filed by National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Bambiha group and its affiliate gangs have wreaked havoc in north India with sensational killings. “They have murdered kabaddi players, political functionaries, etc in a bid to increase their influence. They terrorise people and carry out extortion from businessmen, singers, etc. They committed the murder of Jitender Gogi before a judicial officer in the Rohini Court complex,” says the document.“These incidents are similar to executions carried out by the underworld in the 1990s, which included the murder of Gulshan Kumar, owner of T-Series, the killing of Thakiyudeen Wahid, managing director of East-West Airlines, and the murder of Datta Samant….” says the chargesheet."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 01:53 IST",['india'],114705237
"PM Modi, Spain’s Sanchez open first private military plane facility in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-spains-sanchez-open-first-private-military-plane-facility-in-india/articleshow/114705071.cms,"  NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez on Monday jointly inaugurated the TATA Aircraft Complex in Vadodara for manufacturing C-295 transport aircraft, with Modi saying India’s first private military aircraft factory will not only strengthen relations between the two countries, but also provide momentum to the mission of ‘Make in India, Make for the World’.The Final Assembly Line Plant of the aircraft, co-produced by Airbus Spain and Tata Advanced Systems Ltd in Vadodara, will roll out the first ‘Made in India’ C-295 in 2026, out of a total of 40 aircraft to be manufactured in India, according to a joint statement issued after Modi’s bilateral talks with Sanchez.Airbus Spain is also delivering 16 aircraft in ‘fly-away’ condition to India, out of which six have already been delivered to the Indian Air Force, it said.While all 56 are meant for the air force, govt is planning to order 15 more for the Navy and Coast Guard. The facility can also be used in the future to produce aircraft for the civilian sector.“The C-295 aircraft factory reflects the new work culture of ‘New Bharat’. From idea to execution, the speed with which Bharat operates today is evident here,” said Modi, expressing confidence that aircraft produced in this factory will also be exported worldwide in the future. Sanchez said India can trust Spain.Modi said India’s defence manufacturing ecosystem is reaching new heights. “Had we not taken solid steps a decade ago, it would have been impossible to reach this milestone today. At that time, no one could imagine large-scale defence manufacturing in Bharat. Priorities and identity then were centred on imports. But we chose to tread a new path, setting new goals, and today we can see the results,” he said, adding the project will generate thousands of jobs in the country.The PM also noted that several Indian airlines have placed orders for 1,200 new aircraft. “This means that in the future, this factory will play a crucial role in the design and manufacturing of civil aircraft to meet the needs of both Bharat and the world,” Modi said.Highlighting the growth and transformation of India’s aviation sector in the last decade, Modi remarked that India was providing air connectivity to hundreds of small cities in the country, while simultaneously working to make the country an aviation hub.The joint statement said the leaders expressed satisfaction on the progress made in the C-295 aircraft project as a symbol of the growing defence industrial cooperation between the two countries. “In line with this growing partnership, and in recognition of the advanced capabilities and competitiveness of the Spanish defence industry and its contribution to the goals of the ‘Make in India’ initiative, they encouraged their respective defence industries in other sectors to set up similar joint projects in India.”Modi said India’s defence exports have increased 30 times over the past decade, with the country now exporting equipment to more than 100 countries, while adding that he was looking at the inauguration beyond the manufacturing of transport aircraft.There were many other announcements made during Sanchez’s visit, including one about an MoU for cooperation in rail transport and another on cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters. They also announced the establishment of a Spanish Consulate in Bengaluru and operationalisation of Indian Consulate in Barcelona.According to a list of outcomes, the two countries will set up a fast-track mechanism in DPIIT India and in Directorate General of International Trade and Investment, ministry of economy, trade and business in Spain, for facilitating mutual investments in India and Spain.","  Oct 29, 2024, 01:22 IST",['india'],114705071

""This constituency is a stronghold of Shiv Sena, and the party has won this seat five times in the past. We met our party top brass at least four times during the seat-sharing talks to ensure that the party retained the seat. We are crestfallen that the NCP (SCP) declared its candidate from the seat,"" said Gade.He also predicted that it would be extremely difficult for Kalamkar to defeat Jagtap who has been winning the seat since 2014. UBT sources said during the meeting, a large section of the local party cadre expressed that they would not work for the NCP (SCP) nominee as a mark of protest.""The party's strength in this constituency can be gauged from the fact that in the last Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation polls Sena won the most seats (24). Even after the split in the party, most of the cadre in Ahilyanagar remained with Uddhav Thackeray. The sentiments of the cadre have been hurt as the NCP (SCP) walked away with the seat,"" said Gade.From MVA side, of the 12 assembly seats in Ahilyanagar, NCP (SCP) will be contesting six, Congress three, and UBT two.

But a few posts, like ‘bhistiwala’ or water carrier who supplied potable water in leather pouches and even sprinkled water in narrow lanes in winter, and ‘telephone operator’, who made it possible for officials to get in touch with the staff or vice-versa, were in operation till even a decade or two ago. While the last of the bhistiwalas in operation in central Kolkata have been replaced by tankers and packaged water, telephone operators who worked in manual exchanges have been made redundant by automated systems.There are also posts like ‘scavengers’ — men engaged to carry night soil or excreta from homes without a sanitary latrine — whose phaseout will not evoke any nostalgia. Some of the other vacancies that the civic authorities have decided not to fill up include brick-layer labour, ‘vessel craft driver’ (people engaged at the dock for supply of water to ships) and ‘trolly man’ (civic workers employed for carrying construction materials).The proposal was discussed at the KMC House on Saturday. The MMiC overseeing the personnel department, Baiswanor Chatterjee, said the civic authority declared these posts obsolete and no fresh recruitment was necessary. “ We now need employees to serve citizens, keeping in view the emerging needs,” Chatterjee said.A source said a survey was being conducted on the job profile of the present employees to decide on new recruitment.

Union Bank of India, the complainant in the case, has demanded Rs 11,000 crore dues from the accused, alleging that the loans taken by them were laundered through shell entities.The latest attachment includes bank deposits, mutual funds, shares, various landed properties and buildings acquired in the name of shell companies, apart from that of Corporate Power Ltd and the family members of Manoj Jayaswal and others, ED said.The money laundering probe was initiated by the agency based on an FIR registered by the CBI against Corporate Power Ltd and its promoters alleging criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery.Union Bank of India had alleged that the accused had submitted manipulated project cost statements to avail loans and also diverted bank funds, causing wrongful loss to the tune of Rs 4,037 crore. The bank has claimed an outstanding of Rs 11,379 crore, including interest.The agency had further claimed that the accused had laundered the proceeds of crime using at least 250 shell companies and more than 20 charitable organisations registered for the purpose.“The promoters had engaged in fictitious transactions and fabrication of the accounts of the company and its related entities. Apart from Corporate Power Ltd, other Abhijeet Group entities had similarly committed bank loan frauds such as Corporate Ispat Alloys Ltd amounting to Rs 136 crore, Abhijeet Integrated Steel Ltd amounting to Rs 180 crore, etc,” ED had said after the searches conducted in Aug.On the 250 shell entities created by the accused, ED said its investigation has revealed that “these entities were used for introducing bogus share premium into the books of accounts and to inflate books of Abhijeet Group entities, enabling them to avail fresh loans from banks through manipulating and doctoring financials”.“Dummy directors were employed by the Abhijeet group, usually employees of the group, and dormant companies were found to be used for holding companies. Assets were accumulated from the proceeds of crime in the form of movable assets like listed and unlisted shares, loans and advances, mutual funds, FDs and immovable properties,” ED claimed."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 04:17 IST",['india'],114707796

Those entrusted with protecting common people and their investments had abrogated their responsibilities and were indulging in widescale corruption and malpractice, Gandhi alleged. In the video, Khera is seen explaining to Gandhi the conflicts of interest allegations against Buch and how there were powers behind her that were at work, an apparent reference to the Adani Group.Sharing the video, the party said the role of the Sebi chairperson was to maintain the security of the stock market and to ensure that investments of common Indians were not at risk. However, when the chairperson was involved in manipulating the market to benefit a single player, like the Adani Group, everyone's money was at risk, it said.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Rahul Gandhi wrote, ""What was Sebi chairperson Madhabi Buch taking money from ICICI for?""

This was decided by Kolkata Police after puja organisers in the city claimed that two fires had resulted from them last year. According to joint CP (Headquarters) Meeraj Khalid, the sky lanterns — or phanush — are “amongst the prohibited items” along with non-green firecrackers this year. “We are using section 9 of the West Bengal Fire Services Act,” said Khalid.The provision states that no person shall let off rockets or fireballoons (cops are clubbing sky lanterns under this), or sell fireworks within any local area in which this act is in force, without a licence. This is not the first time that sky lanterns have been banned in the Kolkata region. Both Bidhannagar and Barrackpore cops have prohibited setting off of sky lanterns for several years. The ban is already valid within a 10-km radius of the airport in New Town and Rajahat, and several neighbourhoods in Birati, Madhyamgram and Dum Dum.The Bidhannagar Commissionerate was the first to impose the ban more than six years ago, acting on a written complaint by airport authorities who were concerned about the increasing number of lanterns set off near the airport over the past few years. .The police move has received mixed reactions from the public. While some appreciated the move as a necessary safety measure, others felt it infringed on their traditional practices. Some argued that proper guidelines and regulations could be put in place to ensure the safe use of sky lanterns, rather than imposing a complete ban. “This is news to all of us. We have been using sky lanterns for decades as part of our tradition. We will discuss this with local cops to know the exact guidelines and seek the necessary permissions,” said Arundhuti Pal of Deshapriya Park.Meanwhile, the cops have seized 1,714 kg of illegal crackers in Oct so far and arrested 17 people.We also published the following articles recentlyNo lantern kites near Delhi airport on Diwali as civil aviation ministry issues advisoryThe Ministry of Civil Aviation has banned Lantern Kites and Hot Air Balloons within a 2-kilometer radius of Delhi's IGI Airport to ensure aircraft safety during Diwali.

Saxena frustrates Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/jalaj-saxena-leads-keralas-resilience-against-bengal-in-ranji-trophy-clash/articleshow/114707837.cms,"  Kolkata: Jalaj Saxena did what he is always good at — pulling his side out of the woods. The veteran all-rounder walked in with Kerala in trouble at 78 for five and scripted the recovery from there. Saxena never looked in trouble as he settled down well to take the attack to the rival camp. It was due to his resilient 84 (162 b, 4x12) that Kerala found themselves safe at 267 for seven by the end of Day III of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group ‘C’ clash against Bengal at the JU Salt Lake campus here on Monday.Bengal pacer Ishan Porel once again made early inroads dismissing both the overnight unbeaten batters — Sachin Baby and Akshay Chandran — in consecutive overs within the first hour of third day’s play, but Saxena and Salma Nizar frustrated the Bengal attack stitching together a 140-run seventh-wicket stand that took Kerala to safety.Porel had Kerala skipper Baby clean bowled in his fifth over of the morning for 12 and then had Chandran (31) caught behind when the left-hander tried to pull a short one and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha latched onto an edge jumping on to his right.At 83 for six, Bengal smelt blood. But Saxena had been-there-and-done-that in such situations for ages. He was a bit tentative in the initial stage and survived some close leg-before wicket calls. But once he settled down, he played a fluent knock finding the fence almost at will. Pacer Suraj Sindhu Jaiswal finally had Saxena bowled in the final session of play. But Mohammed Azharuddeen (30*) and Nizar (64*) were involved in an unbroken 44-run eighth-wicket stand to ensure Kerala end the day on top.Brief scores: Kerala 267/7 in 102 ovs (Jalaj Saxena 84, Salman Nizar 64*, Mohammed Azharuddeen 30*; Ishan Porel 5/83) vs BengalWe also published the following articles recentlyRanji Trophy: Jalaj Saxena stands tall for Kerala against BengalJalaj Saxena's resilient 84 helped Kerala recover from a precarious 78 for five to a safer 267 for seven against Bengal in a Ranji Trophy match.

Sharma said: “The company involved worked only for a single day before halting its operations, and removed no muck on Monday. If the forest department and these companies are serious about clearing the damaged areas, they need to act more decisively.”Last week, the Bilaspur police had registered five cases against three companies over illegal muck dumping dating back to 2012 when these contractors had started with the Kiratpur-Manali project. The forest department, which had reported them, confirmed receiving directives to ensure that the road-construction companies clear the Bilaspur forests of all the muck they had dumped. The FIRs filed at Swarghat police station under sections 15 (penalty for contravention) and 16 (offences by companies) of the Environment Protection Act and section 277 (polluting natural spring or reservoir) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), suggest that these companies filled the forests and nullahs of Gara, Mehla, Dadnal, Jabbal, and Sunan villages with muck.In June, responding to a petition from the FVPS, the Himachal Pradesh high court ordered the local authorities to punish those who had polluted the Bhakra Dam’s reservoir and its tributaries. The high court also mandated the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police to take all necessary measures to clear the muck from Govind Sagar lake’s shores, tributaries, forests, and public lands. The petitioner argued that the illegal dumping of muck had not only polluted water sources but also declined fish population, affecting the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen.We also published the following articles recentlyPolice lodge cases against road building firms for dumping muck in forest areasBilaspur police have filed cases against companies employed by NHAI for illegal muck-dumping along the Kiratpur-Manali highway, which has polluted the Bhakra dam reservoir.

The e-rickshaws are crucial for providing last mile connectivity in areas where city buses and share taxis are not available.The share taxi owners said they have been forced to take the decision as they were unable to carry on with their business due to heavy fines levied on the drivers by the transport department.President of all Guwahati Metro Share Taxi Owners’ Association, Dip Majumdar, said the number of e-rickshaws has gone up sharply in the last 3-4 years. “Despite the strict prohibition on movement of these vehicles on main roads under the Motor Vehicles Act, they are moving in an unrestricted manner causing severe traffic congestion and affecting the business of share taxi drivers and owners. So, we want their movement to be restricted on main roads on or before Nov 10. We will halt our services if no action is taken within the given time,” Majumdar told the media on Monday.

Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said on Monday, “Ganga’s level is estimated to remain around one meter high during the Chhath this year, as the festival is 12 days ahead as compared to the last year,” said the DM, while inspecting the preparations for approach roads and parking spaces near ghats. He said the Ganga’s level would recede by about 70 cm from its current level by the Chhath day. “We are closely monitoring the situation and making adequate preparations, including barricading, as per the safety norms. Situation at the Collectorate ghat would further improve in coming two-three days,” he said. Talking about the approach roads and parking facilities at various Chhath ghats, Singh said the workers engaged in the work have been asked to repair and remove hindrances on the way, if any. “We are mainly inspecting the approach paths and parking arrangements at ghats where huge crowd and a large number of vehicles are expected on the festival day,” said the DM, adding, the administration is also finalizing the point up to which the vehicles will be allowed on the Chhath day. The vehicles coming from Atal Path would be diverted to a route under JP Setu, where parking facilities for around 4,000-5,000 vehicles have been arranged, said the DM. “A large parking space has also been created for the vehicles approaching from under pass of JP Ganga Path.

The dwindling interest among the younger generation, coupled with gradual atrophy of the business, has pushed this centuries-old art form to the brink of extinction. The deluge of Chinese-made luminaries in the markets has further exacerbated the issue, posing an existential threat to the artisans and their trade.A practitioner of this craft, Hitran Kumar (50) expressed his concerns about the challenges of sustaining a family solely through pottery in this era of soaring inflation. “Pottery demands relentless effort and unwavering dedication. Persisting in this craft becomes futile when the financial rewards are meagre. Earthen products are being replaced by artificial alternatives in the markets,” he said. Kumar mentioned the younger generation is gravitating towards alternative vocations, such as govt or private sector jobs.“Within my family, I will be the final individual to make pottery. My children won’t continue this tradition. I operate a modest grocery store and engage in farming to fulfil our necessities,” he revealed, emphasizing that “it is heartbreaking to witness the imminent extinction of a centuries-old tradition.” Kumar, who has been practising pottery for approximately 28 years, has crafted several hundred earthen lamps to sell during the Diwali festivities this year.The Hira and Kumar communities of potters in Assam have been traditionally involved in this art. What distinguishes them is their unique techniques. Instead of wheels, Hiras use stones of varying sizes and a wooden beater to shape their pots.

People died in the cyclone. But there was no death after the cyclone because of the timely govt response,” he said.Gamang, who was CM for nine months from Feb 1999 to Dec 1999, said the subsequent govts did not properly document the deaths, the steps taken, and the massive humanitarian aid the state received for reasons best known to them. “I was relieved as CM while busy distributing relief to people,” he said. The Congress leadership removed Gamang in Dec 1999 and made Hemananda Biswal Odisha CM ahead of the assembly election in 2000. Congress lost the election, and Naveen Patnaik became CM in March 2000, leading a BJD-BJP coalition govt.Gamang said in the brief period of around two months after the cyclone, he laid the foundation of a disaster response plan, which his successors built upon. The Centre came out with the National Disaster Act, 2005 much later. “One must understand that we worked from scratch. The communication system was rudimentary. Predictions were not as advanced and accurate as they are today. Prior intervention was largely not possible, though an alert of the cyclone was given to people. However, post-cyclone, the govt did a great job. I managed to talk to some then CMs such as Jyoti Basu and N Chandrababu Naidu, among others. The response was phenomenal,” he said.The former CM said the work then was for the public and not for publicity. “The initiatives were humanitarian and not for political motives. Hundreds of trucks of relief materials reached Odisha then. On a decentralised approach, those were checked and sent directly to panchayats. It was a very effective way to deliver relief,” he said.Gamang regretted that the Super Cyclone was not documented by the subsequent govts. “There was an estimate by govt agencies of more than 10,000 deaths. Some put the death figures higher. My successor govt did not document the deaths properly to figure out the casualties and the scale of destruction,” he said.","  Oct 29, 2024, 04:27 IST","['city', 'bhubaneswar']",114708401

Spain's Rodri wins Ballon d'Or for best player in the world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/spains-rodri-wins-ballon-dor-for-best-player-in-the-world/articleshow/114709657.cms," Rodri (Image credit: Ballon d'Or) NEW DELHI: In a historic moment for Spanish football, Manchester City midfielder Rodri was crowned the winner of the prestigious Ballon d'Or award on Monday. The 28-year-old Madrid native beat out strong contenders Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham, both of Real Madrid, to claim the coveted prize. Rodri's exceptional performances were crucial in Manchester City's unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title triumph last season. Additionally, he was named the best player at this year's European Championship, where Spain clinched a record-extending fourth title.Rodri's victory marks a significant milestone, as he becomes the first defensive midfielder to win the Ballon d'Or since Lothar Matthaus in 1990 and only the third Spaniard to receive the honor, following in the footsteps of Alfredo Di Stefano (1957 and 1959) and Luis Suarez (1960). Despite Spain's ""golden generation"" winning the 2010 World Cup and the 2008 and 2012 Euros, no Spaniard had claimed the award in over 60 years. Rodri's unique skillset has been instrumental in Manchester City's dominance in England and Spain's resurgence on the European stage, earning him high praise from his coach, Pep Guardiola, who hailed him as ""the best midfielder in the world.""In his acceptance speech, Rodri emphasized that his victory was not just a personal achievement but a triumph for Spanish football and the often-overlooked role of midfielders. ""Today is not a victory for me, it is for Spanish football, for so many players who have not won it and have deserved it, like (Andres) Iniesta, Xavi (Hernandez), Iker (Casillas), Sergio Busquets, so many others. It is for Spanish football and for the figure of the midfielder,"" Rodri said on stage at the ceremony.""Today many friends have written to me and have told me that football has won, for giving visibility to so many midfielders who have a job in the shadows and today it is coming to light.""I'm a regular guy with values, who studies, who tries to do things right and doesn't try to follow the stereotypes and even so I have been able to get to the top, and it is thanks to all of you.""NO MESSI OR RONALDORodri's win is particularly notable as he becomes only the third player not named Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo to claim the award since 2008. It also marks the first time since 2003 that neither Messi nor Ronaldo made the final 30-man list of nominees. In other categories, Rodri's national teammate Lamine Yamal won the Kopa Trophy for the best Under-21 player, while Aitana Bonmati secured the women's Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year. Jennifer Hermoso was honored with the Socrates Award for her role in the fight for women's rights in football and her courageous stance against sexism in sport. Real Madrid, despite boycotting the ceremony in anticipation of Vinicius not winning the men's award, was named men's club of the year, with their manager Carlo Ancelotti receiving the men's coach of the year award. Barcelona claimed the trophy for women's best club after both teams achieved the European and Spanish league double last season.","  Oct 29, 2024, 05:35 IST","['sports', 'football', 'top-stories']",114709657

One had expected that despite its niche reach and appeal, it may end up bringing in those numbers at the box office, just like in case of '12th Fail' or 'Laapataa Ladies'. Though, the budget of 'Jigra' looks certainly higher than these two movies and it may have required more to be a theatrical hit.Jigra Movie ReviewOn its Day 18, the movie has managed to make only Rs 25 lakh according to Sacnilk. This comes as a dip from Sunday number which was around Rs 65 lakh. The total collection of 'Jigra' now is Rs 31.25 crore. At this pace, even a lifetime total of Rs 35 crore seems difficult for 'Jigra'.

What Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos said on paper not endorsing a presidential candidate: It creates a perception of ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/what-washington-post-owner-jeff-bezos-said-on-paper-not-endorsing-a-presidential-candidate-it-creates-a-perception-of-/articleshow/114710599.cms,"  Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, has openly defended the newspaper's decision to refrain from endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election, arguing that such endorsements create a damaging ""perception of bias."" In an op-ed in the paper, Bezos wrote, ""What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.""The decision marked a significant departure from The Post’s tradition of endorsing presidential candidates for over three decades, a move some critics argue weakens the paper’s role in upholding democratic values. Bezos expressed deep concerns about the public's dwindling trust in the media, claiming that ""Our profession is now the least trusted of all.""In his op-ed, Bezos drew a parallel between election processes and journalism, noting that newspapers, like voting machines, must both operate accurately and be perceived as accurate. This distinction, he argued, is essential but currently lacking in the media landscape. ""Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality"". Bezos acknowledged that while the decision not to endorse a candidate is unlikely to transform public perceptions overnight, it represents ""a meaningful step in the right direction"" towards building trust. He admitted the timing was less than ideal, revealing that the paper's management made the decision just weeks before the election, which he described as ""inadequate planning.""Bezos, said that the move is part of a larger battle to protect credible journalism amid rising misinformation. ""The world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice,"" he said.The Amazon CEO concluded with a call for renewed purpose, declaring that he would not let The Post fade into ""irrelevance,"" stating, ""Now more than ever, the world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice.""Backlash and resignationsThe decision has stirred controversy within The Post, leading to criticism from staff and readers alike. Veteran columnist Robert Kagan, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, resigned, while former editor Marty Baron condemned the move as ""cowardice."" Critics have questioned Bezos’s motivations, noting his business ties and history of clashes with Trump, and argue that the decision undermines The Post’s responsibility to hold public figures accountable. This frustration extended to The Post’s readership, as NPR reported that over 200,000 digital subscribers have cancelled subscriptions in protest.Earlier, Publisher and chief executive officer of the paper, William Lewis framed the decision as a return to The Post's early traditions, explaining to staff that the paper aimed to create an ""independent space"" free from political sway. However, Lewis acknowledged that readers may interpret the decision as an implicit endorsement or condemnation of a candidate, but reiterated that it aligns with The Post's principles of integrity and independence. Bezos dismissed claims that any political agenda influenced the decision, recounting an incident on the day of the announcement when Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp unexpectedly met with former President Trump. “I sighed when I found out,” Bezos noted, “because I knew it would provide ammunition to those who would like to frame this as anything other than a principled decision.”"," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 10:01 IST","['world', 'us', 'us-presidential-elections']",114710599

It's essential to assess your current needs; if attending doesn't align with your energy, consider a gentle, diplomatic way to decline. Your natural leadership qualities often make you feel responsible for others' enjoyment, but remember that self-care is paramount. Take this day to recharge if needed, especially if you've been overly focused on responsibilities. However, if you do decide to engage socially, you may unexpectedly find inspiration in the rhythm and energy around you, possibly sparking a new idea or perspective that will serve you in the coming days. A little social refreshment could rejuvenate you, yet staying true to your current needs will ensure a balanced and harmonious outcome. Trust your instincts to guide you to the right choice today.2 (Those born on the 2nd, 11th, 20th, or 29th of any given month are ruled by the Numerology number 2)The essence of harmony and beauty surrounds you today, urging you to create a warm and inviting atmosphere in your personal space. As a naturally intuitive and gentle soul, you might find yourself rearranging things, adding new decor, or simply tidying up with an eye for aesthetics. This act of beautification isn’t just about the physical space; it reflects an inner peace that you’re cultivating, a serenity that radiates out to others in your circle. Relationships are likely to feel smoother today, as you’re in a state of balance, which fosters greater understanding with loved ones. This is also a day for deeper self-reflection; let your emotions guide you as you seek to understand what truly brings you happiness and contentment. Embrace your empathetic nature, and don't hesitate to reach out to friends or family if you sense they need support. Your calm energy can be incredibly uplifting to others today.3 (Those born on the 3rd, 12th, 21st, or 30th of any month are ruled by the Numerology number 3)Today invites you to pause, reflect, and tune into your inner voice rather than pushing forward with action. Life might feel a bit overwhelming, with a sense that responsibilities are piling up; however, try not to let self-doubt cloud your perspective. Meditation or even a few moments of quiet contemplation can help you realign with your purpose and bring much-needed clarity. Let go of the urge to force solutions, trusting that patience will allow things to unfold in their own time. This is a day to nurture your creative spirit too; whether through art, writing, or a thoughtful conversation, expressing yourself will alleviate any inner tension. Reflecting on your recent achievements and efforts will help you regain perspective. Remember, calmness is your ally, and soon, new insights and a fresh wave of motivation will emerge.

You might find that while you crave time alone to recharge, there’s also a pull toward spending time with those you love. Finding balance is key today, and creating boundaries that allow you to engage with others while honoring your need for space will be beneficial. Reflect on what nurtures your soul; perhaps taking a walk alone or engaging in a favorite solitary activity could help restore your sense of self. At the same time, stay open to the support others offer, as they may provide insight or comfort. Remember that maintaining healthy boundaries doesn’t diminish your love for others but strengthens your ability to connect deeply. Today, balancing solitude and connection will be empowering.5 (Those born on the 5th, 14th, or 23rd of any month are ruled by the Numerology number 5)The energies today suggest that finding harmony between your inner emotions and the demands of daily life might be challenging. You could feel a sense of restlessness, perhaps noticing that the usual routines feel a bit tedious or uninspiring. This can lead to a feeling of fatigue or lack of focus, even if you can't pinpoint an exact cause. Try to take a step back from tasks that feel overwhelming and infuse your day with small moments of joy or spontaneity. Consider activities that awaken your curiosity or creativity, as these can refresh your spirit. A change in scenery, such as a short walk or a new environment, might provide just the boost you need. Remember that feeling energized is often linked to our mental state, so if you prioritize joy and curiosity, it will help overcome any feelings of lethargy and restore a sense of fulfillment by day’s end.6 (Those born on the 6th, 15th, or 24th of any month are ruled by the Numerology number 6)Today, you may feel an increased focus on your social influence and professional aspirations.

There’s a natural magnetism in you now, and people are likely to feel comforted and inspired by your presence.

You may want to reach out to someone you care about or reconnect with an old friend, as your warmth and sensitivity can bring healing to others. Trust your intuition, as it is finely attuned today, guiding you toward choices that align with peace, beauty, and genuine connection.8 (Those born on the 8th, 17th, or 26th of any month are ruled by the Numerology number 8)Today’s energies bring a renewed appreciation for the meaningful relationships and bonds in your life.

Matthew Wade retires from international cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/matthew-wade-retires-from-international-cricket/articleshow/114710751.cms," Matthew Wade (ICC Photo) NEW DELHI: Matthew Wade, one of Australia’s most successful and revered players, is set to embark on a coaching career following his retirement from international cricket.Wade played 36 Test matches, 97 One-Day Internationals, and 92 T20 Internationals for Australia, with his last appearance at this year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the West Indies.The Tasmanian played pivotal roles in numerous Australian victories over his 13-year career, most notably in the 2021 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, where his performance was integral to the team's success.He will join Australia’s coaching staff for the upcoming T20 series against Pakistan under Andre Borovec, staying on for the ODI series that begins in Melbourne next week.While Wade starts his coaching journey, he will continue playing domestic cricket for Tasmania and in the Big Bash League with the Hobart Hurricanes for at least the next two summers.Wade has been coaching Tasmanian youth and second XI sides during the winter, roles he hopes to expand within the Australian system while playing through the summer.Matthew Wade said: “I was fully aware my international days were most likely over at the end of the last T20 World Cup. My international retirement and coaching has been a constant conversation with George (Bailey) and Andrew (McDonald) over the past six months.“Coaching has been on my radar over the last few years and thankfully some great opportunities have come my way, for which I am very grateful and excited.“I will continue to play BBL and the odd franchise league over the summer months, but around those commitments as a player I am investing heavily in my coaching.“As my international career closes, I want to thank all of my Australian teammates, staff, and coaches. I enjoyed the ride, as challenging as it can be at the international level. Without good people around me, I would have never got as much out of myself as I did.“I also thank my family, mum, dad, and sisters, for the countless hours they put in over the years getting me to games and training.“Lastly to Julia and the kids. I can’t thank them enough for the sacrifices they have made for me to continue to pursue my dreams. No words can explain how grateful I am to them; none of this would have happened without their support.”Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley said: “Congratulations to Matthew on what has been a wonderful international career during which his skill and versatility has made him an outstanding performer across all formats.“I’m delighted he will add to his massive contribution by coaching the next generation of stars and also continuing to light up the Big Bash with the Hobart Hurricanes.”Executive General Manager, High Performance & National Teams, Ben Oliver said: “We extend our thanks and congratulations to Matthew on an outstanding international career.“Matthew was a much-loved teammate in Australian teams across all formats over the past 13 years. His resilience and adaptability were a feature throughout his career, and he should be incredibly proud of the impact that he had at international level.“We look forward to Matthew drawing on his wealth of experience as he transitions into coaching, and we wish he and his family the very best for the future.”","  Oct 29, 2024, 06:28 IST","['sports', 'cricket', 'news']",114710751
What Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos said on paper not endorsing a presidential candidate: It creates a perception of ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-washington-post-owner-jeff-bezos-said-on-paper-not-endorsing-a-presidential-candidate-it-creates-a-perception-of-/articleshow/114710171.cms,"  Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, has openly defended the newspaper's decision to refrain from endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election, arguing that such endorsements create a damaging ""perception of bias."" In an op-ed in the paper, Bezos wrote, ""What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.""The decision marked a significant departure from The Post’s tradition of endorsing presidential candidates for over three decades, a move some critics argue weakens the paper’s role in upholding democratic values. Bezos expressed deep concerns about the public's dwindling trust in the media, claiming that ""Our profession is now the least trusted of all.""In his op-ed, Bezos drew a parallel between election processes and journalism, noting that newspapers, like voting machines, must both operate accurately and be perceived as accurate. This distinction, he argued, is essential but currently lacking in the media landscape. ""Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality"". Bezos acknowledged that while the decision not to endorse a candidate is unlikely to transform public perceptions overnight, it represents ""a meaningful step in the right direction"" towards building trust. He admitted the timing was less than ideal, revealing that the paper's management made the decision just weeks before the election, which he described as ""inadequate planning.""Bezos, said that the move is part of a larger battle to protect credible journalism amid rising misinformation. ""The world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice,"" he said.The Amazon CEO concluded with a call for renewed purpose, declaring that he would not let The Post fade into ""irrelevance,"" stating, ""Now more than ever, the world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice.""Backlash and resignationsThe decision has stirred controversy within The Post, leading to criticism from staff and readers alike. Veteran columnist Robert Kagan, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, resigned, while former editor Marty Baron condemned the move as ""cowardice."" Critics have questioned Bezos’s motivations, noting his business ties and history of clashes with Trump, and argue that the decision undermines The Post’s responsibility to hold public figures accountable. This frustration extended to The Post’s readership, as NPR reported that over 200,000 digital subscribers have cancelled subscriptions in protest.Earlier, Publisher and chief executive officer of the paper, William Lewis framed the decision as a return to The Post's early traditions, explaining to staff that the paper aimed to create an ""independent space"" free from political sway. However, Lewis acknowledged that readers may interpret the decision as an implicit endorsement or condemnation of a candidate, but reiterated that it aligns with The Post's principles of integrity and independence. Bezos dismissed claims that any political agenda influenced the decision, recounting an incident on the day of the announcement when Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp unexpectedly met with former President Trump. “I sighed when I found out,” Bezos noted, “because I knew it would provide ammunition to those who would like to frame this as anything other than a principled decision.”"," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 10:01 IST","['world', 'us']",114710171

Cops likely to bring back online trading scam mastermind from Goa today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-police-captures-online-trading-scam-mastermind-dipankar-barman-in-goa/articleshow/114708571.cms,"  Guwahati: Assam Police is likely to bring online trading swindler Dipankar Barman, who was apprehended in Goa after evading cops for over two months, to Guwahati on Tuesday via transit remand. Guwahati police commissioner Diganta Barah disclosed on Monday that a police team had been stationed in Goa for about two weeks after tracing Barman’s location in the state. Barman fled Assam just before the first case against him was registered on Aug 22. The probe was later transferred to CBI, and he was held in a newly registered case based on a separate complaint. “He had been on the run since Aug 18. However, our team continued with technical analysis, which led to his location being traced to Goa,” Barah explained. Despite the police squad’s efforts, they struggled to apprehend him as he frequently changed hotels and homestays, and stopped using his phone and social media accounts. “The police team gathered crucial intelligence and developed sources in the area. They discovered how he managed to secure funds transferred from Assam for his expenses. Based on this intelligence, his location was traced to a specific area,” he added. A trap was set, and Barman was captured in Pernel. “Over Rs 27 lakh in cash, his Indian passport, and jewellery were recovered during the search of the homestay where he had been staying for several days,” the commissioner said. He confirmed that Barman would be interrogated upon his return to Guwahati.

5 Zodiac signs that will bring wealth and prosperity this Dhanteras 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/zodiacs-astrology/5-zodiac-signs-that-will-bring-wealth-and-prosperity-this-dhanteras-2024/articleshow/114703015.cms,"  Dhanteras is the festival which sets the tone of Diwali as well as new financial year in traditional terms. Based on the planetary composition, let us dive into 5 Zodiac Signs who are going to attract wealth and financial abundance on this Dhanteras 2024:TaurusThis Dhanteras, Taurus is about to see expansion driven by wise financial judgments. Retrograde Jupiter in the second house helps Taurians to be in a good position for the increase of riches by means of smart design. Solid returns are possible via partnerships, hence people in business or looking for new ones should search for investments carefully. Government agencies and family also show support, therefore providing a balanced basis for sustainable development. Given financial luck is particularly strong, today is also a time to investigate underdeveloped ideas or enterprises.LeoLeos emphasizes as very beneficial this season investments in public sector stocks and government-linked assets. The stars counsel Lions to approach money pragmatically rather than basing decisions only on emotional impulses. Dhanteras is the perfect time for Leos to make future-oriented financial decisions since chances to increase money through long-term, solid assets are on increase. Establishing defined limits in business interactions can assist individuals working in the professional spheres stay respected and prevent misinterpretation. Prosperity results from harmonizing feelings with strategic vision.LibraLibras are in a perfect position to encourage fresh alliances, which will probably pay off handsomely this Dhanteras. Strong intuitive skills during this period could cause Libras to find themselves seeing possibilities before they present themselves. The paper notes possible benefits in government areas, suggesting a good moment for discussions or official support requests. Libras should concentrate on keeping harmony in personal relationships since domestic peace will increase financial fortune. Furthermore advised for continuous success is investing in gold or maintaining lucky symbols close by.ScorpioWith some of their income coming from unanticipated sources, such inheritances or speculative activity, Scorpios should expect modest financial success. Particularly via a husband or another powerful woman, luck is closely linked to female relationships. For individuals drawn to disciplines like astrology or financial speculation, knowledge acquired during this time may prove rather profitable. Dhanteras's energy magnifies Scorpio's latent abilities, hence before making any new investment, they should concentrate on fully knowing the specifics of any available opportunity. Keeping openness in relationships helps improve financial situation even more.PiscesFor Pisceans, particularly those straying from traditional financial routes, this Dhanteras provides stability in riches and health. Pisceans are urged to investigate prospects that might first seem unusual since these routes have great pay-off. Keeping close relationships with family members—especially siblings—will help to avoid financial losses and promote a consistent flow of wealth. Pisceans should be aware of their words since a balanced attitude to relationships and positive language can affect both spiritual and financial riches.This article is written by, Sidhharrth S Kumaar, Registered Pharmacist, Astro Numerologist, Life & Relationship Coach, Vaastu Expert, Energy Healer, Music Therapist, and Founder, NumroVani.

Cops take over DAP distribution in Hry’s mustard-season scrum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryana-police-take-control-of-dap-fertilizer-distribution-amid-mustard-planting-chaos/articleshow/114708418.cms,"  Hisar: Mad scramble at the DAP (diammonium phosphate) centres has forced Haryana to wield its stick and move the distribution of this short-supplied key fertiliser to police stations in some areas. Long queues in the busy season of sowing mustard are making farmers impatient and angry.At multiple distribution sites, chaos and tensions have led to police intervention, and in one instance, a lathi charge left several farmers injured. Demand for DAP has surged because mustard, state’s key cash crop, is being sown. Yet, the farmers are getting just a fraction of the 50-bag allotment allowed by rules. At Tosham Bhiwani district, the scarcity escalated to such a point where the co-operative society resorted to distributing fertiliser at a police station on Oct 27, following unrest. Similar scenes played out in Charkhi Dadri and Narnaul, where farmers lined up late into the night.The crisis in Uchana turned violent on Oct 26, when a clash between farmers and police led to a lathi charge, injuring several farmers and heightening tensions. Kisan Sabha’s Hisar president Shamsher Singh Nambardar and Fatehabad district chief Vishnudutt Sharma blamed the authorities that had failed to meet the fertiliser demand and stranded farmers in long queues. Nambardar said: “The availability of DAP is very low compared with the area under Rabi crops. The impact will be on both mustard and the upcoming wheat season.”Delays in tender, external factorsHisar’s deputy director of agriculture, Rajbir Kudawala, attributed the shortage to delays in DAP imports, caused by surged prices of phosphatic fertilisers in China and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The delayed tender process had also resulted in late supplies, he claimed, highlighting how Hisar district had a demand of 25,000 metric tonnes of DAP, but had received only 8,000 MT, so far. Of this, 60% is allocated to private shopkeepers, and the remaining 40% is distributed through govt agencies.Kudawala has mentioned that while farmers are allowed to purchase up to 50 bags, the limited supply has forced restrictions for fair distribution. Responding to complaints about private shopkeepers’ forcing farmers to buy additional products, he noted that while no cases had been reported this year, four shop licences had been suspended last year over similar issues.We also published the following articles recentlyCM Mann meets Nadda to seek fertilizer DAP on priority basisPunjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann met Union Minister JP Nadda urging priority supply of Diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer for wheat cultivation, amid supply issues due to Red Sea problems.

Omega 3 vs Omega 6: What's the difference?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/omega-3-vs-omega-6-whats-the-difference/articleshow/114704420.cms,"  Difference between omega 3 and omega 6The difference between Omega 3 and Omega 6fatty acids is quite far-fetched whether you consider their sources or how they impact our daily lives. Omega 6 fatty acids would include AA (Arachidonic Acid) and LA (Linoleic Acid). These contribute to the development and overall well-being of a person. It is undeniable that both Omega 3 and Omega 6 are beneficial for the body, however maintaining the correct proportion between the two can help in longevity. Sources of omega3 and omega 6Omega 6 can be abundantly found in vegetable oils, nuts and seeds of different sorts. Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids are important, although both profoundly impact the human body differently. Food items like Walnuts, Flaxseeds, and Fish contain a lot of omega-3, which has anti-inflammatory benefits while taking care of your heart, brain, and overall mood. According to Dr. Archana Batra, Dietician, Certified Diabetes Educator, “The three primary forms of omega-3 fatty acids are ALA, EPA, and DHA which are of significant importance for many processes in the body. Frequent consumption can help lower the risks of chronic illnesses like heart disease and more. EPA and DHA are present abundantly in fish, whereas ALA is more commonly found in plant-based sources. Pancreatic enzymes and Bile salts help break down the fatty acids into the small intestine, after which they are dispersed to the other organs.”Effect of omega-3 on healthOne cannot neglect the positive impact of omega-3 fatty acids on our heart health. They help reduce the chances of strokes or various cardiovascular diseases. Omega-3 helps reduce blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and keep triglyceride levels in the body under control. Incorporating omega-3-rich foods into your diet can be a powerful step toward preventing chronic illnesses like heart disease.According to Eshanka Wahi, a Dubai & Delhi-based Culinary Nutritionist, Holistic Wellness Coach and Founder, Eat Clean With Eshanka, “Omega 3 fatty acids are abundantly present in many plant-based sources like chia seeds and even seafood like salmon. These are exceptional for psychological and emotional well-being. These serve as a crucial healing element during a new mother’s postpartum by helping restore equilibrium and reducing anxiety during this challenging phase.”Effect of omega-6 on healthOmega-6 fatty acids are present in food items like seeds and nuts and can often lead to swelling and discomfort if consumed too much. In the context of the average Western diet, Omega 6 can be found in excess in comparison to Omega-3, which can lead to obesity and diabetes. In that case, to improve overall health and deal with metabolism issues, one can consider boosting their consumption of Omega 3 and reducing their intake of Omega 6 to accomplish an equitable proportion of 4:1. Even though Omega 3 is very essential for the body, excessive intake of the same can be detrimental. One must consume foods high in Omega 3 and be mindful when it comes to sources with Omega 6. Simple alterations can help achieve this goal by choosing grilled food over fried food or using olive oil instead of other oils. Making sure that you maintain a healthy equilibrium ensures better personal health. Understanding the role of these fatty acids is essential, especially for new moms who often juggle multiple responsibilities. By making simple dietary changes such as reducing processed foods high in Omega 6 and increasing Omega 3 sources like fatty fish and flaxseeds, one can significantly enhance their well-being and that of their families.Omega-3 can help curb smoking addiction"," Updated: Oct 30, 2024, 17:37 IST","['life-style', 'health-fitness', 'diet']",114704420

While the woman died on Monday, the others are recuperating at different hospitals.According to police, Reshma Begum (31) and her daughters, aged 12 and 14 years, had momos from a street vendor on October 25. Soon afterwards, the trio started showing signs of severe food poisoning - vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. They did not immediately go to a hospital, assuming a little rest would make them feel better. “They were rushed to hospital on October 27, as their condition started deteriorating. While Reshma died on the way to the hospital, her two daughters are still under treatment,” said a police officer.Following a complaint from her family members, food safety officials of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, along with Banjara Hills police, tracked down the street vendor from Chintal Basti, Khairatabad. Police registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and took into custody two persons from Bihar running the business.During investigation, police found that at least 20 other residents of nearby areas were hospitalised with similar complaints – all after having momos from the same stall.Food safety officials carried out an inspection and found that the establishment was operating without the mandatory FSSAI licence, and that the food was being prepared under unhygienic conditions.“We have collected samples of food articles found at the location and sent them to the state food laboratory for analysis. We have also issued orders to stop the operations. The blood culture and stool test reports of the victims have been collected to determine the exact cause of food poisoning,” said a food safety official.“We have also written to the SHO of Banjara Hills police station to conduct an inquiry and take necessary action against the accused,” he added.","  Oct 29, 2024, 04:47 IST",['india'],114708981

The air quality improved marginally to ‘poor’ by 6pm, with an AQI of 299, as winds picked up. However, it’s likely to remain ‘very poor’ over the next few days and may turn ‘severe’ on Diwali. Wind direction on Monday was south-easterly, but the met department’s forecast shows it is likely to change to north-westerly on Diwali. North-westerly winds are favourable for transport of smoke from stubble burning sites to Delhi.Experts said winds turn calm during the night time, causing accumulation of pollutants, while light winds prevail during the daytime. However, on Monday, wind speed increased, leading to dispersion of pollutants.“Winds play an important role in dispersion of pollutants in the absence of any significant weather activity like rain, which washes them out. The average wind speed during the daytime on Monday was 15-18 kmph,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice chairman, Skymet Meteorology.The air quality is likely to stay ‘very poor’ till Wednesday and may turn ‘severe’ on Diwali if there are added emissions from firecrackers and stubble burning. “The outlook for the subsequent six days from Thursday is that the air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category,” said the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences.CAQM, which reviewed the air quality in NCR Friday, directed Delhi govt and NCR states to ensure strict implementation of the SC order on firecrackers and their respective regulations. It directed agencies to work in coordination to ensure AQI levels don’t compel the necessity to invoke further stages of GRAP.“NCR states and Delhi govt were directed to augment the capacity and intensify the use of mechanised road sweeping and sprinkling of water, identify more highrises for installation of anti-smog guns, and deploy nodal officers to address air pollution from hotspots. The strict implementation of SC orders and orders on firecrackers was highlighted, in view that festivals this year coincide with the peak paddy harvesting season in northern India,” CAQM said Monday.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature stood at 34.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal while the minimum settled at 20.4 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 08:49 IST",['india'],114709547

Defamation FIR against social media channel admin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/defamation-fir-filed-against-social-media-admin-over-sexual-exploitation-allegations-in-jind/articleshow/114708535.cms,"  Jind: In a case involving allegations of sexual exploitation and a honey trap racket, the station house officer (SHO) of the city’s women’s police station has filed an FIR (first-information report) against a social media platform administrator for claiming that the SHO and a woman DSP supported the superintendent of police (SP) in these alleged activities.Several women cops have emailed their complaints to Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini, additional director general of police (ADGP), and other senior officials, accusing the SP and SHO of running a sex and honey-trap racket that targets officials. In response to the allegations, the accused SHO filed an FIR against the admin of a social media channel, accusing him of extortion and defamation. Her complaint suggests that the admin, in collaboration with other people, had on Monday published unverified allegations of sexual exploitation and misconduct involving senior police officials, without evidence and as part of a deliberate attempt to damage their reputation amid an ongoing investigation.She claimed further that an inquiry involving 19 women police officers had found no proof to substantiate the accusations, and despite this, the social media admin allegedly had published another defamatory post, disregarding their dignity and professional standing. The SHO has also alleged that the complaint against her lacked signatures initially, and a new one was fabricated with forged signatures to intensify the defamation scheme.Julana’s Congress legislator, Vinesh Phogat, weighed in on the controversy, taking to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to call for strict action against the SP.

He claimed that the ""outrageous rhetoric"" from the Harris campaign has likely contributed to two assassination attempts on him in the past three months.""My father used to always say, never use the word Nazi. never use the word Hitler. And yet they use that word freely, both words. They use it, he's Hitler. And then they say he's a Nazi. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi,"" the former president added.""This is the kind of outrageous rhetoric that has resulted in two assassination attempts in the last three months,"" he added.The former president also addressed the topic of fatigue, saying that despite campaigning for 58 consecutive days, he does not feel tired. He contrasted this with Kamala, who he claimed took days off during the campaign, alleging, ""she's taking a day off. Like, a couple of days ago, she took, like, two days off in a row.""Concerns surrounding Trump's rhetoric have intensified, particularly after retired General John Kelly, Trump's longest-serving chief of staff, stated in a recent interview that the former president fits the definition of a fascist.Tensions have soared as polls indicate a tightly contested race, fuelled by fears that Trump may once again refuse to accept defeat, as he did in 2020. The campaign has been further complicated by troubling reports of ballot box fires in competitive districts in Washington and Oregon, raising concerns about election integrity.During his rally, Trump again targeted Harris, calling her a ""hater,"" and urged his supporters to ""get out and vote."" He promised that, with their help, ""eight days from now we're going to defeat Kamala."" Meanwhile, Harris has been actively campaigning in Michigan, emphasising unity and condemning Trump's divisive rhetoric. ""He is focused... on dividing our country,"" she said.With early voting well underway, more than 47 million Americans have cast their ballots. The stakes are particularly high in Georgia, one of seven swing states that could ultimately determine the outcome of the election. Trump is actively courting key voter demographics, including religious groups, asserting, ""I think this is a country that needs religion,"" and framing Harris's administration as a threat to traditional values.Harris is set to deliver a ""closing argument"" in Washington, a location imbued with historical significance after Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 07:31 IST","['world', 'us']",114710833
Grenade found in college near Manipur Raj Bhavan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/live-hand-grenade-discovery-sparks-panic-at-imphal-college-near-manipur-raj-bhavan/articleshow/114708538.cms,"  Guwahati: A live hand grenade was discovered at the entrance of GP Women’s College, located near the Manipur Raj Bhavan in Imphal, on Monday morning, amid growing concerns over explosion threats. This alarming incident prompted students to protest, calling for enhanced safety measures for educational institutions, even after the grenade was successfully defused by the bomb disposal squad. The situation is particularly serious given the numerous extortion threats reported against various educational establishments in Manipur. The women’s college is strategically positioned just 100 meter from the Raj Bhavan and 300 metre from the chief minister’s official residence, highlighting the gravity of the situation. A police source said the college authorities have not yet confirmed whether they received any extortion threats from militant groups or other miscreants. “Police have expedited the investigation and are working to identify those responsible for placing the hand grenade at the college entrance. CCTV footage from the area is being thoroughly examined,” said an official from Imphal police station. Authorities have yet to determine if militants or miscreants are involved in this act targeting the govt college. The grenade was found with a warning note criticising the “fascist education system” and advocating for a “free education movement” that honours the rights of working-class students. The note read: “Down with the fascist education system; honour the rights of the proletarian students’ free education movement; glory to the proletarian students.” A police officer said pedestrians near the college gate on Central Jail Road first noticed the grenade around 6 am on Monday. A police team cordoned off the area, and the bomb disposal squad was called in.

He revealed that this decision led to a fallout with the channel, causing tension in their relationship.In an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Ashutosh Kaushik revealed that his contract with the channel required him to give 30% of all his earnings to the channel for two years after his Roadies win. However, he mentioned that he had no one to guide him, plan his career moves, or manage his projects during this time.He shared, ""I won Rs 1 crore as prize money on Bigg Boss, but MTV insisted on taking ₹30 lakh, claiming I owed them that amount,” Ashutosh shared. “The contract stated that 30% of any earnings over two years had to go to MTV. I argued that the Rs 1 crore was a prize, a gift, and not a salary I’d earned.”Ashutosh Kaushik, the Bigg Boss 2 winner, also revealed that he was the lowest-paid contestant of his season, earning just Rs 25,000 per week. With no one to negotiate for him, he signed the contract on his own. After disputing the 30% deduction, he and the channel reached a compromise, agreeing that he’d be hired as a VJ with a monthly salary of Rs 1.5 lakh. However, he was never actually hired as a VJ and instead only received a monthly cheque.Discussing his Roadies prize, Ashutosh shared that he won Rs 2.5 lakhs and a bike. However, there was a catch—he had to pay the taxes on the bike himself before he could collect it from the showroom.In the same interview, Ashutosh revealed that he often clashed with Raghu Ram, the show’s anchor and judge, as he found it difficult to handle Raghu’s intense and abusive language. Raghu, known for his blunt and confrontational judging style, became an unforgettable figure on the show, which enjoyed immense popularity among young viewers in its prime.Friendship or Romance?

Worried about your pets this Diwali? Here's how to keep them safe and happy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/worried-about-your-pets-this-diwali-heres-how-to-keep-them-safe-and-happy/articleshow/114701858.cms,"  Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is a time of joy, celebration, and togetherness for families across India. The vibrant festivities, dazzling fireworks, and lively gatherings bring immense happiness to people. However, the loud noises and sudden bursts of light can be stressful and frightening for pets. Ensuring their safety and comfort during this festive season is crucial. By taking proactive steps to create a calming environment and using strategies to reduce their anxiety, pet owners can help their furry companions feel secure and relaxed. Here are some essential tips to keep your pets safe and happy during Diwali.Tips to keep your pets safe this Diwali 2024Create a safe spaceDiwali is a season of joy and festivities, but the loud sounds of fireworks can be quite stressful for our furry companions. Designate a quiet, secure area in your home where your pet can retreat during the festivities. This space should be away from windows and doors to minimise exposure to loud noises. Equip it with their favourite bedding, toys, and blankets to make it feel cozy and inviting. You might even consider adding a comforting item, like a piece of your clothing, to provide them with a sense of security. Familiar scents can help ease anxiety, making this refuge a perfect hideaway during the noise of Diwali.Stay calm and reassuringYour behaviour has a significant impact on your pet's anxiety levels. During Diwali, it’s essential to remain calm and composed, as pets can pick up on their owners’ emotions. Use gentle petting, soothing words, and positive reinforcement to reassure them. If your pet seeks your attention, don’t hesitate to provide it—your presence can be incredibly comforting. Engage in light, positive activities like gentle play or cuddling to help distract them from the noise. This emotional support can help them feel more secure during stressful times.Engage in distractionsDistraction can be an effective way to help your pets cope with loud noises. Provide them with engaging toys or activities that can capture their attention and keep their minds occupied. Puzzle toys filled with treats, interactive games, or durable chew toys can provide mental stimulation and help divert their focus away from the noise. Additionally, spending quality time with your pet through play or training can strengthen your bond and provide comfort, making them feel more secure amidst the chaos of Diwali celebrations.Use calming aidsThere are various calming aids available specifically designed for pets to help alleviate anxiety during stressful times like Diwali. Consider using calming sprays that contain natural ingredients, pheromone diffusers that mimic comforting scents, or anxiety wraps that apply gentle pressure to help your pet feel more secure. Consult with your veterinarian about suitable options and dosages to ensure your pet's safety and well-being. These products can create a soothing environment and significantly reduce stress levels for your furry friends.Play music or white noisePlaying soft music or white noise can significantly help mask the sounds of fireworks and other loud noises. Choose calming tunes, such as classical music or soft instrumental pieces, as these can create a soothing atmosphere for your pets. Alternatively, white noise machines or apps can produce consistent sound that drowns out sudden loud noises. Ensure the volume is set at a comfortable level; you want it to be calming rather than overwhelming. Familiar sounds can provide comfort and help alleviate anxiety during the festivities.Keep windows and doors closedTo minimise the loud sounds of fireworks and other celebrations, make sure all windows and doors in your home are securely closed. This will help keep the noise levels down and create a more peaceful environment for your pets. Additionally, you can use heavy curtains or soundproofing materials to further dampen outside sounds. If your pets are particularly anxious, consider keeping them in the designated safe space during peak noise times. This will help shield them from sudden, loud noises that could startle or frighten them.Also Read | Burmese python: Know its characteristics, diet, ecological impact and conservation status","  Oct 29, 2024, 07:00 IST","['etimes', 'trending']",114701858
Third gen Cong candidate looks to keep family legacy alive in Samaguri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/congress-aims-to-maintain-family-legacy-in-samaguri-by-polls/articleshow/114708439.cms,"  Guwahati: The Samaguri assembly seat — the only constituency where the BJP lacks some confidence in securing victory in the forthcoming Assam bypolls, according to political pundits — is a matter of immense prestige for the grand old party. If Congress candidate Tanzil Hussain triumphs, three generations of a family will emerge as MLAs and ministers from Samaguri in Nagaon district.Dhubri MP Rakibul Hussain, whose son and NSUI leader Tanzil is contending for the seat, said on Monday that the BJP has been incapable of approaching voters with their accomplishments in implementing schemes in the minority-inhabited seat in Nagaon. Instead, Rakibul alleged that the saffron party has resorted to ‘instilling fear’ among the electorate to garner votes. He asserted that the schemes executed by the Congress more than a decade ago are sufficient to clinch the seat for Congress. Rakibul himself served as a five-time MLA from Samaguri since 2001 (until he became MP this year), and his father also represented the constituency for two terms.Nurul Hussain, Rakibul’s father, contested from the Congress (S) ticket in the 1983 election and joined Congress (I) after winning. He again emerged victorious as a Congress candidate in the 1991 assembly polls and became a state minister in the Hiteswar Saikia govt.Political analyst Paresh Baruah, a leader of NCP, opined that family politics has evidently been a factor in Samaguri, but Tanzil being an NSUI leader might have also merited a ticket from the Congress perspective. “Rakibul knows the nooks and corners of Samaguri. Despite facing criticism for promoting family politics, Tanzil’s win will prove his organisational capabilities as a student leader as well. Opposition victory in Samaguri will matter a great deal in this bypoll,” said Baruah.Tanzil is the national secretary and treasurer of NSUI, which is Congress’s student wing. Tanzil is one of the rare examples to secure a Congress ticket from NSUI in Assam. He feels Congress’s victory is certain. “Congress won the day bypolls were announced for Samaguri,” Tanzil said in an interview. He said Rakibul Hussain is spearheading the campaign as a Congress leader, not as his father. “He is our leader. His notable works as an able MLA and minister are an example before us, and we are banking on it,” Tanzil said.Tanzil has been focusing on the burning issues like worry over amalgamation of schools in the state.We also published the following articles recentlyBJP, Congress in fix over candidate for Kedarnath bypollBoth BJP and Congress are facing challenges in selecting their candidates for the Kedarnath bypoll seat following the death of BJP MLA Shaila Rani Rawat.

"People in Punjab spend more from pocket for treatment, reveals survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/punjabs-staggering-out-of-pocket-healthcare-costs-alarm-residents/articleshow/114708474.cms,"  Chandigarh: Despite the govt’s efforts to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, people in Punjab bear a substantial portion of costs directly at the point of treatment. This indicates a heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payments.Alarmingly, Punjab has one of the country’s highest out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure rates, surpassing the national average. To meet medical expenses, the people are forced to either deplete their savings or resort to borrowing. In Punjab, the average medical expenditure for hospitalised treatment over the last 365 days was Rs 8,306 for rural households, compared to Rs 8,272 for urban households, according to the Comprehensive Annual Modular Survey conducted for the period between July 2022 and June 2023 by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation. At Rs 2,110, per person expenditure on hospitalised treatment, however, was higher in urban areas as compared to Rs 1,891 in rural areas.For non-hospitalised treatment over the last 30 days, the average medical expenditure per household was Rs 1,161 in rural areas and Rs 950 in urban areas, while per person expense was Rs 264 in rural areas and Rs 242 in urban areas. The average out-of-pocket medical expenditure per household on hospitalisation over the last one year was Rs 7,374 in rural areas and Rs 6,963 in urban areas, compared to the national average of Rs 4,129 in rural areas and Rs 5,290 in urban areas. The average per person out-of-pocket expense stood at Rs 1,679 in rural areas and Rs 1,776 in urban areas. Additionally, the average out-of-pocket medical expenditure per household on non-hospitalisation over the last one month was Rs 1,139 in rural areas and Rs 916 in urban areas, against the national averages of Rs 539 and Rs 606, respectively.To determine the total health expenditure incurred by households, the survey collected data at disaggregated levels across various components, including package and non-package expenses such as doctor’s fees, medicine costs, diagnostic tests, bed charges, other medical expenses, and transport expenses. Expenditures were recorded when initially borne by the patient’s household, regardless of whether they were reimbursed later.Prof Aswini Kumar Nanda, department of economics, Central University, Jammu, attributed the high out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare to heavy reliance on private health facilities. This is largely due to inadequate public health services, he said. Even in areas where public health facilities exist, people often choose private facilities due to better services and health insurance coverage, Prof Nanda explained.Since insurance coverage is generally insufficient to cover all expenses, especially for chronic diseases like cancer, people end up paying out of pocket. For financially vulnerable individuals, this can lead to dire consequences, such as forgoing essential treatment or resorting to desperate financing options. “Improving public healthcare by enhancing the coverage and quality of services can help reduce out-of-pocket spending,” said Prof Nanda.","  Oct 29, 2024, 04:29 IST","['city', 'chandigarh']",114708474

'I'm not a Nazi': Donald Trump hits back at Kamala Harris during Georgia rally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections/im-not-a-nazi-donald-trump-hits-back-kamala-harris-during-georgia-rally/articleshow/114710938.cms,"  Donald Trump in a charged address to supporters in Atlanta, Georgia, declared, ""I'm not a Nazi,"" as he sought to counter accusations of authoritarianism from critics, including a former chief of staff who recently labelled him a fascist. He claimed that the ""outrageous rhetoric"" from the Harris campaign has likely contributed to two assassination attempts on him in the past three months.""My father used to always say, never use the word Nazi. never use the word Hitler. And yet they use that word freely, both words. They use it, he's Hitler. And then they say he's a Nazi. I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi,"" the former president added.""This is the kind of outrageous rhetoric that has resulted in two assassination attempts in the last three months,"" he added.The former president also addressed the topic of fatigue, saying that despite campaigning for 58 consecutive days, he does not feel tired. He contrasted this with Kamala, who he claimed took days off during the campaign, alleging, ""she's taking a day off. Like, a couple of days ago, she took, like, two days off in a row.""Concerns surrounding Trump's rhetoric have intensified, particularly after retired General John Kelly, Trump's longest-serving chief of staff, stated in a recent interview that the former president fits the definition of a fascist.Tensions have soared as polls indicate a tightly contested race, fuelled by fears that Trump may once again refuse to accept defeat, as he did in 2020. The campaign has been further complicated by troubling reports of ballot box fires in competitive districts in Washington and Oregon, raising concerns about election integrity.During his rally, Trump again targeted Harris, calling her a ""hater,"" and urged his supporters to ""get out and vote."" He promised that, with their help, ""eight days from now we're going to defeat Kamala."" Meanwhile, Harris has been actively campaigning in Michigan, emphasising unity and condemning Trump's divisive rhetoric. ""He is focused... on dividing our country,"" she said.With early voting well underway, more than 47 million Americans have cast their ballots. The stakes are particularly high in Georgia, one of seven swing states that could ultimately determine the outcome of the election. Trump is actively courting key voter demographics, including religious groups, asserting, ""I think this is a country that needs religion,"" and framing Harris's administration as a threat to traditional values.Harris is set to deliver a ""closing argument"" in Washington, a location imbued with historical significance after Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021."," Updated: Oct 29, 2024, 07:31 IST","['world', 'us', 'us-presidential-elections']",114710938

The program will include field visits and indoor activities. “Pakhya refers to a period of 15 days in which numerous school students will be participating in this. They will be taken for bird watching programmes in wildlife sanctuaries and forests. Additionally, there will also be exhibitions and guest lectures regarding conservation of wild animals,” Datta said.Datta expressed concern that the rich traditions and customs of wildlife conservation, which were originally part of India’s social structure and heritage, were tainted after the British introduced the practice of killing wild animals and birds for entertainment. The killing continued until the Wildlife Protection Act of India was enacted in 1972. However, in some districts of the state, people still hunt exotic birds for sport, often without understanding the consequences. Referring to an incident in the life of Maharishi Valmiki, Datta mentioned that the sage advocated for the conservation of wild birds and became the first person to create literary works related to nature.
